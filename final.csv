fibm0x7,By announcing the self quarantined it paints picture that maybe it not so bad being that tested positive and tested negative More information is clarity not obscurity negative tests does not kickstart panic What does is telling us we have tested No more information to report We know there are more people affected and spreading this as we can see around the world in other countries but we re being told don worry about it we re safe Risk is low Also you can really put judgment on the number of tests performed against the number of infected people when there could be upto days of infectious people without being admitted to hospital or going to be seen This is hidden data point that is causing the infection to spread The CDC announced in early February they had thousands of tests to send out There no reason why they shouldn be testing anyone that is suspect of Coronavirus who tests negative for other flu viruses other than to mask the data Panic as much as nobody wants is inevitable The extremity of that panic will continue building up until the truth comes out If there are cases growing around the world people will prioritize as time passes when they want to start preparing If you release and dump everyone at once that what mass hysteria happens Not everyone will respond to quarantine areas the same way For example if they told me there is quarantine in Miami FL and live in Houston TX people here are not going to panic or go crazy and buy everything off the shelves That just doesn make sense But if the epidemic grows and starts getting closer to Texas then yes that anxiety starts growing and people here will start preparing for the enemy coming Hiding the information does not help us It like on the CDC website The CDC does not recommend individuals to wear facemasks however if you click the link for Healthcare Providers on how to evaluate and treat COVID patients it absolutely says wear facemask ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fkcv5dr,Extract In the most scripted of presidential settings prime time televised address to the nation President Trump decided to ad lib and his errors triggered market meltdown panicked travelers overseas and crystallized for his critics just how dangerously he has fumbled his management of the coronavirus Even Trump man practically allergic to admitting mistakes knew he screwed up by declaring Wednesday night that his ban on travel from Europe would include cargo and trade and acknowledged as much to aides in the Oval Office as soon as he finished speaking according to one senior administration official and second person both with knowledge of the episode Jared Kushner his son in law and senior adviser who has seized control over some aspects of the government coronavirus response reassured Trump that aides would correct his misstatement four administration officials said and they scrambled to do just that The president also told staffers to make sure other countries did not believe trade would be affected and even sent cleanup tweet of his own The restriction stops people not goods he wrote Other administration officials rushed to alert the public that S citizens would be exempt from the travel ban after scores of Americans upon digesting Trump speech phoned government offices and raced to airports in Europe out of concern that they would not be able to fly home Trump minute Oval Office address Wednesday night reflected not only his handling of the coronavirus crisis but in some ways much of his presidency It was riddled with errors nationalist and xenophobic in tone limited in its empathy and boastful of both his own decisions and the supremacy of the nation he leads Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average fell in real time with virtually each word Trump uttered signaling lack of confidence among investors that he had control of the crisis and previewing another bloodbath once the markets opened Thursday morning Trump who believed that by giving the speech he would appear in command and that his remarks would reassure financial markets and the country was in an unusually foul mood and sounded at times apoplectic on Thursday as he watched stocks tumble and digested widespread criticism of his speech according to former senior administration official briefed on his private conversations This official like many others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information or make candid assessments Ben Rhodes senior White House aide who helped former president Barack Obama script and manage his responses to numerous crises predicted that Wednesday night address will stand as the moment people associate with the fact that Donald Trump failed the biggest test of his presidency think we ll look back on this as defining moment of the Trump presidency because it speaks to larger concerns that people already had about Trump that he can tell the truth that he doesn value expertise that he doesn take the presidency seriously enough Rhodes said As often is the case after Trump gives major speech his Republican allies offered chorus of praise on television and social media for his fantastic speech and decisive actions and unique strength Inside the White House however aides and advisers privately acknowledged that Trump failed to accomplish the primary goal of his speech reassuring the nation and described it as disappointing and far from his best performance Trump speech contained at least two errors and significant omission He said the travel ban would apply to cargo it did not He said health insurance companies would waive patients co payments for coronavirus testing and treatment industry officials later clarified that they would waive payments for testing only And he did not fully explain the details of his travel restrictions leaving out the fact that S citizens would be exempt The president remarks were devoid of much substantive information on other matters Trump provided no update for citizens on the spread of the virus nor on the availability and results of testing Public health experts have said testing citizens for the coronavirus is essential for identifying new cases and limiting its spread but the nation has experienced chronic shortage of test kits after weeks of missteps by the government Trump devoted only two short sentences to the topic and they were vague Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly day by day We are moving very quickly Stylistically the president himself seemed ill at ease in the formal setting offering monotone and labored delivery from behind the Resolute Desk twiddling his thumbs and even in moments struggling to read words on the teleprompter One senior administration official said Trump heart was not in the speech It was jolting said Julian Zelizer presidential historian at Princeton University People are naturally scared People want to see leader who has commanding presence In some ways the country is worse off after message like that The speech itself was rushed After weeks of playing down the coronavirus threat to the United States Trump was reluctant to appreciate the full scope of the crisis on his hands But with the markets in free fall he decided early Wednesday that he wanted to give the televised speech that night administration officials said This startled some of his aides and set off frantic scramble to arrange airtime on television networks iron out logistics for his delivery and prepare draft of what he would say the officials said This was real missed opportunity to not just have couple of sentences in there about how other people need to put partisanship aside and come together but to really show it the former senior administration official said noting that Trump could have sought to rise above the politics of the moment to convey sense of unity and common purpose The speech almost writes itself in way this person added It can be kind of formulaic It not rocket science The speech was largely written by Kushner and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller who were still making tweaks to the text until moments before Trump delivered it according to people familiar with the process Thirty minutes before Trump appeared live on camera final draft of his remarks still had not circulated widely within the White House one of those people said And senior health experts in the administration did not review final draft of the remarks according to senior administration official While Kushner and Miller crafted the remarks coterie of other officials were involved in the process and joined Trump in the Oval Office to watch his delivery One person with knowledge of the speech said they included Vice President Pence Ivanka Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and sizable group of White House aides Christopher Liddell Eric Ueland Dan Scavino Hogan Gidley Judd Deere John McEntee Anthony Ornato and Nick Luna Some officials faulted the rushed timeline for the messy speech which they said could have been delivered even sooner as it became clear the virus was well on its way to becoming global pandemic designation the World Health Organization officially bestowed upon the coronavirus Wednesday Everyone usually gets Trump where he needs to be within couple of days one official said The problem is we don have couple of days Kushner only recently became involved with the administration virus response beginning to attend meetings in his capacity as senior adviser according to officials but inserted himself more fully as he became increasingly convinced that more tangible action was needed He supported Trump decision to ban most travel from Europe for days and has pushed for further concrete steps some of which are expected to be announced in the coming days officials said There was some frustration among other White House aides at the sudden involvement by Kushner who they viewed as simply parachuting in and whose vast portfolio including Middle East peace negotiations immigration and the reelection campaign has been the subject of mockery in some circles The travel ban has been criticized by some experts for being largely ineffectual at this point considering the virus already has spread throughout the United States as well as the fact that Trump exempted the United Kingdom meaning anyone trying to fly to America from Europe could simply get to London first Tom Bossert Trump former homeland security adviser was sharply critical of the measure saying it would have been helpful earlier but now the key focus should be on community mitigation such as closing schools or quarantining sick individuals There little value to European travel restrictions Bossert tweeted Thursday morning Poor use of time amp energy On NBC Today show Thursday morning host Savannah Guthrie read Pence who is overseeing the administration coronavirus response snippet of Trump tweet in which the president accused the Fake News Media and their partner the Democrat Party of trying to inflame the CoronaVirus situation There been some irresponsible rhetoric the vice president told Guthrie before going on to praise Trump for his concern for the health and well being of the American public It was initially unclear if Pence was perhaps criticizing his boss for the president own irresponsible rhetoric But when asked an aide to the vice president quickly insisted that he was not ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

by day description of symptoms from day through day and treatment for the first patient in the USA He began feeling ill on Jan was admitted to the hospital on Jan th and was released from the hospital Feb rd Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps www straitstimes com asia east asia reporters notebook life and death in wuhan coronavirus icu ve observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about week There are all sorts of mild symptoms feebleness shortness of breath some people have fevers some don Based on studies of our cases the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever per cent of cases feebleness per cent cough per cent muscle pains per cent difficulties breathing while less common symptoms include headaches dizziness stomach pain diarrhea nausea vomiting But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse At this stage people should go to the hospital The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications some may need machine assisted respiration When the body other organs start to fail that when it becomes severe while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes type of white blood cell and see an improvement in their immune systems and have been brought back so to speak But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end experience multiple organ failure and die For most the illness is over in two weeks whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe if they can survive three weeks they re good Those that can will die in three weeks And this Symptom Progression Day to Day From First Case of Novel Coronavirus in the United States year old male https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa On January year old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County Washington with day history of cough and subjective fever On checking into the clinic the patient put on mask in the waiting room After waiting approximately minutes he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by provider He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan China The patient stated that he had seen health alert from the S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and because of his symptoms and recent travel decided to see health care provider Given the patient travel history the local and state health departments were immediately notified Together with the urgent care clinician the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for nCoV on the basis of current CDC persons under investigation case definitions Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens After specimen collection the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department On January the CDC confirmed that the patient nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for nCoV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rRT PCR assay In coordination with CDC subject matter experts state and local health officials emergency medical services and hospital leadership and staff the patient was admitted to an airborne isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact droplet and airborne precautions with eye protection On admission the patient reported persistent dry cough and day history of nausea and vomiting he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain Vital signs were within normal ranges On physical examination the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable After admission the patient received supportive care including liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea On days through of hospitalization days through of illness the patient vital signs remained largely stable apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia Figure The patient continued to report nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued On the afternoon of hospital day the patient passed loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort second episode of loose stool was reported overnight sample of this stool was collected for rRT PCR testing along with additional respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal and serum The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT PCR for nCoV whereas the serum remained negative Treatment during this time was largely supportive For symptom management the patient received as needed antipyretic therapy consisting of mg of acetaminophen every hours and mg of ibuprofen every hours He also received mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately liters of normal saline over the first days of hospitalization chest radiograph taken on hospital day illness day was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities Figure However second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day illness day showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung Figure These radiographic findings coincided with change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day when the patient oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as while he was breathing ambient air On day the patient was started on supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at liters per minute Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital acquired pneumonia treatment with vancomycin mg loading dose followed by administered intravenously every hours and cefepime administered intravenously every hours was initiated On hospital day illness day fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs finding consistent with atypical pneumonia Figure and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation Given the radiographic findings the decision to administer oxygen supplementation the patient ongoing fevers the persistent positive nCoV RNA at multiple sites and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy Treatment with intravenous remdesivir novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development was initiated on the evening of day and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day and cefepime was discontinued on the following day after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus On hospital day illness day the patient clinical condition improved Supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his oxygen saturation values improved to to while he was breathing ambient air The previous bilateral lower lobe rales were no longer present His appetite improved and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea As of January the patient remains hospitalized He is afebrile and all symptoms have

fka8n5z,Here you go What Does the Coronavirus Do to the Body Here what scientists have learned about how the new virus infects and attacks cells and how it can affect organs beyond the lungs As cases of coronavirus infection proliferate around the world and governments take extraordinary measures to limit the spread there is still lot of confusion about what exactly the virus does to people bodies The symptoms fever cough shortness of breath can signal any number of illnesses from flu to strep to the common cold Here is what medical experts and researchers have learned so far about the progression of the infection caused by this new coronavirus and what they still don know How does this coronavirus cause infection The virus is spread through droplets transmitted into the air from coughing or sneezing which people nearby can take in through their nose mouth or eyes The viral particles in these droplets travel quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat attaching to particular receptor in cells beginning there Coronavirus particles have spiked proteins sticking out from their surfaces and these spikes hook onto cell membranes allowing the virus genetic material to enter the human cell That genetic material proceeds to hijack the metabolism of the cell and say in effect Don do your usual job Your job now is to help me multiply and make the virus said Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville How does that process cause respiratory problems As copies of the virus multiply they burst out and infect neighboring cells The symptoms often start in the back of the throat with sore throat and dry cough The virus then crawls progressively down the bronchial tubes Dr Schaffner said When the virus reaches the lungs their mucous membranes become inflamed That can damage the alveoli or lung sacs and they have to work harder to carry out their function of supplying oxygen to the blood that circulates throughout our body and removing carbon dioxide from the blood so that it can be exhaled If you get swelling there it makes it that much more difficult for oxygen to swim across the mucous membrane said Dr Amy Compton Phillips the chief clinical officer for the Providence Health System which included the hospital in Everett Wash that had the first reported case of coronavirus in the United States in January The swelling and the impaired flow of oxygen can cause those areas in the lungs to fill with fluid pus and dead cells Pneumonia an infection in the lung can occur Some people have so much trouble breathing they need to be put on ventilator In the worst cases known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome the lungs fill with so much fluid that no amount of breathing support can help and the patient dies What trajectory does the virus take in the lungs Dr Shu Yuan Xiao professor of pathology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine has examined pathology reports on coronavirus patients in China He said the virus appears to start in peripheral areas on both sides of the lung and can take while to reach the upper respiratory tract the trachea and other central airways Dr Xiao who also serves as the director of the Center For Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics at Wuhan University said that pattern helps explain why in Wuhan where the outbreak began many of the earliest cases were not identified immediately The initial testing regimen in many Chinese hospitals did not always detect infection in the peripheral lungs so some people with symptoms were sent home without treatment They either go to other hospitals to seek treatment or stay home and infect their family he said That one of the reasons there was such wide spread recent study from team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that more than half of patients in China had normal CT scans early in their disease That study and work by Dr Xiao show that as the disease progresses CT scans show ground glass opacities kind of hazy veil in parts of the lung that are evident in many types of viral respiratory infections Those opaque areas can scatter and thicken in places as the illness worsens creating what radiologists call crazy paving pattern on the scan Are the lungs the only part of the body affected Not necessarily Dr Compton Phillips said the infection can spread through the mucous membranes from the nose down to the rectum So while the virus appears to zero in on the lungs it may also be able to infect cells in the gastrointestinal system experts say This may be why some patients have symptoms like diarrhea or indigestion The virus can also get into the bloodstream Dr Schaffner said The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that RNA from the new coronavirus has been detected in blood and stool specimens but that it unclear whether infectious virus can persist in blood or stool Bone marrow and organs like the liver can become inflamed too said Dr George Diaz section leader for infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett Wash whose team treated the first S coronavirus patient There may also be some inflammation in small blood vessels as happened with SARS the viral outbreak in and The virus will actually land on organs like the heart the kidney the liver and may cause some direct damage to those organs Dr Schaffner said As the body immune system shifts into high gear to battle the infection the resulting inflammation may cause those organs to malfunction he said As result some patients may endure damage that is inflicted not just by the virus but by their own immune system as it rages to combat the infection Experts have not yet documented whether the virus can affect the brain But scientists who studied SARS have reported some evidence that the SARS virus could infiltrate the brain in some patients Given the similarity between SARS and Covid the infection caused by the new coronavirus paper published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology argued that the possibility that the new coronavirus might be able to infect some nerve cells should not be ruled out Why do some people get very ill but most don About percent of people infected with the new coronavirus have relatively mild symptoms But about percent of people become more seriously ill and in about percent of patients in China which has had the most cases the disease has been fatal Experts say the effects appear to depend on how robust or weakened person immune system is Older people or those with underlying health issues like diabetes or another chronic illness are more likely to develop severe symptoms Dr Xiao conducted pathological examinations of two people in China who went into hospital in Wuhan in January for different reason they needed surgery for early stage lung cancer but whose records later showed that they had also had coronavirus infection which the hospital did not recognize at the time Neither patient lung cancer was advanced enough to kill them he said One of those patients an year old woman with diabetes died from pneumonia caused by coronavirus Dr Xiao said the records showed The other patient year old man was somewhat healthier with history of hypertension that he had managed well for years Dr Xiao said the man had successful surgery to remove lung tumor was discharged and nine days later returned to the hospital because he had fever and cough that was determined to be coronavirus Dr Xiao said that the man had almost certainly been infected during his first stay in the hospital since other patients in his post surgical recovery room were later found to have coronavirus Like many other cases it took the man days to show respiratory symptoms The man recovered after days in the hospital infectious disease unit Experts say that when patients like that recover it is often because the supportive care fluids breathing support and other treatment allows them to outlast the worst effects of the inflammation caused by the virus What do scientists still not know about coronavirus patients lot Although the illness resembles SARS in many respects and has elements in common with influenza and pneumonia the course patient coronavirus will take is not yet fully understood Some patients can remain stable for over week and then suddenly develop pneumonia Dr Diaz said Some patients seem to recover but then develop symptoms again Dr Xiao said that some patients in China recovered but got sick again apparently because they had damaged and vulnerable lung tissue that was subsequently attacked by bacteria in their body Some of those patients ended up dying from bacterial infection not the virus But that didn appear to cause the majority of deaths he said Other cases have been tragic mysteries Dr Xiao said he personally knew man and woman who got infected but seemed to be improving Then the man deteriorated and was hospitalized He was in C getting oxygen and he texted his wife that he was getting better he had good appetite and so on Dr Xiao said But then in the late afternoon she stopped receiving texts from him She didn know what was going on And by m she got notice from the hospital that he had passed ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fhpvrqq,China Communist Party leader Xi Jinping issued internal orders about the coronavirus epidemic in early January about two weeks before his first public remarks on the outbreak according to speech by Mr Xi that was published Saturday The speech confirmed for the first time that he was aware of the virus while officials at its epicenter were openly downplaying its dangers In the speech Mr Xi said that he had initially given orders about the coronavirus outbreak on Jan during meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee the Communist Party topmost body That places Mr Xi involvement with fighting the epidemic earlier than previously known Mr Xi earliest public comment on the epidemic was Jan when he gave brief instructions on the issue that were published by state media In early January leaders in Wuhan the city at the epicenter of the outbreak were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission Mr Xi did not disclose details of his instructions on Jan but it seems clear that Wuhan officials would have known that the country top leader was paying attention to the outbreak The evidence that Mr Xi was addressing the spread of the coronavirus earlier than previously known has now been released apparently in an effort to show that he has commanded the fight against the epidemic notwithstanding rumors that he let others take the lead ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story The speech in which Mr Xi described his initial involvement in countering the spread of the coronavirus was published by Qiushi or Seeking Truth the Communist Party top doctrinal journal Mr Xi gave the speech on Feb when the coronavirus was spiraling into national crisis for China prompting the lockdown of Wuhan and other hard hit cities in Hubei Province and chain reaction of restrictions across other parts of the country Mr Xi is dominant figure in Chinese politics and his utterances are treated as lodestones by officials Here are some other main points from the newly published Feb speech Mr Xi in charge Mr Xi emphasized that he has been constantly involved in decisions about the crisis and he indicates that he gave the authorization to put Wuhan and other areas of Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown from Jan In the speech Mr Xi recalled clearly demanded that Hubei Province exercise comprehensive strict control over the outflow of individuals You have free articles remaining Subscribe to The Times Two focal points in nationwide people war Mr Xi describes the effort to end the epidemic as an all encompassing people war across China But he singles out two key battlegrounds Hubei Province where the infections and deaths have been concentrated and Beijing the national capital Beijing has special status Mr Xi told the meeting He said Strengthen management and control of key populations Controlling the narrative Mr Xi stresses the importance of preserving social stability through easing public fear providing adequate supplies of food and other needs and demonstrating confidence that the epidemic can be beaten And he also emphasizes winning over public opinion at home and abroad There must be closer monitoring and assessment of opinion proactively speaking out and giving positive guidance Mr Xi said of Chinese public sentiment Seize the initiative and effectively shape international opinion he added Tell well the story of China fight against the epidemic ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Coping with economic damage Mr Xi acknowledges that the epidemic and fight to curtail it will drag on China economy by putting pressure on industry especially smaller firms by slowing construction projects and by cooling domestic and foreign trade In response Mr Xi said the government will provide financial support for businesses help migrant workers return to their jobs when production resumes and step up support for projects He also said the blow to consumer spending could be offset by encouraging spending in new areas such as phone networks as well as online entertainment and education He also encouraged areas across China to lower restrictions on car purchases ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

fkqmv5w,Via google translate Many young corona patients in intensive care probably due to carnival The idea that only vulnerable seniors are at risk from the coronavirus is incorrect Of the corona patients who are in intensive care in the Netherlands on Monday evening about half are younger than says Diederik Gommers chairman of the Dutch Association for Intensive Care We think that is because the outbreak is mainly in Brabant and that it has to do with carnival Carnival goers are generally bit younger Doctor on corona patients in IC Distribution between old and young is fifty fifty In general seniors and people who are already extra vulnerable do have more to fear from the coronavirus Older people get sick faster If you have other diseases you are most at risk of ending up in intensive care bad heart for example diabetes or high blood pressure Operating room personnel However healthy younger patients also end up in IC What is the problem with them In some people there is kind of overreaction of the body to the virus which causes them to develop severe pneumonia We don understand exactly why but we sometimes see it during the normal flu season Can the Netherlands handle it if the number of patients in intensive care increases in the coming weeks The number of beds can be expanded to Gommers estimates That should be enough In recent years we were mainly suffering from shortage of personnel so we did not use all facilities That now gives some space but then we need personnel What you now see is that all planned operations are canceled and we ask the operating room personnel to help in the intensive care unit No chance without ventilation Another risk is possible shortage of respirators We are working with all kinds of people to see if we can find additional devices from companies and we may get from the military If we call the manufacturers in the US Germany or Italy we notice that all countries have such devices want to buy They are exhausted can no longer breathe themselves IC doctor Diederik Gommers on corona patients in intensive care How are the people who end up in intensive care Gommers Those people come to the ER with respiratory problems Often they can breathe themselves the first day then they deteriorate hard They have to work very hard to get air in them They exhaust themselves as it were and at that point we are going to intubate We insert tube and take up breathing with device It is called mechanical ventilation Without that device they have no chance They are exhausted cannot breathe themselves anymore patient does not notice the ventilation it is put to sleep just like during an operation Lost pounds of muscle The major problem for patients in intensive care is that the ventilator with the coronavirus can be needed for very long time It is really heavy double sided pneumonia Usually you spend days on the ventilator But from Italy and China we know that the corona virus takes longer which can take up to weeks We also already have few patients who have entered the fourth week Then you actually want to reduce the support for the ventilator And then you have long recovery period ahead You have been kept asleep for so long and you have been breathing for so long that you are recovering for half year to year Some patients never recover completely Because of the illness and the prolonged ventilation you gain kilos of muscle lost ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

fl9zcrk,DeepL translation On Sunday GP Carin Littooij was guest on the TV programme Op and told at the table that she had tested positive for the coronavirus few days earlier In doing so the GP complied with the guidelines of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment RIVM but not with the advice of the World Health Organization WHO Littooij told in the broadcast on Sunday that she had tested positive for the COVID virus last week Earlier her husband had already become infected with the virus The fact that the doctor still participated in the programme led to lot of criticism online Also fellow guest and party leader Rob Jetten was visibly surprised that the positively tested general practitioner was sitting at the table Littooij said that she had discussed her participation in the programme with the GGD and had to go to work Nevertheless she received lot of criticism online because people felt that she was endangering her fellow guests Littooij who is also member of the corona team of the National General Practitioners Association LHV said she complied with the RIVM guidelines These guidelines state that patients who do not experience any symptoms for hours can be considered cured Would it have been better for Littooij to stay at home RIVM advice now is infected persons should remain in home isolation until they no longer show any symptoms for hours from slight runny nose to cough At that time according to the RIVM website they are cured and can no longer infect others Littooij states in statement of the LHV that she had been symptom free for more than three days on Sunday since Thursday morning So she had already amply passed the hour limit during the broadcast Her television appearance was extensively tuned with the GGD and the RIVM The editors of Op were also aware of her infection confirms BNNVARA The broadcaster emphasizes that the consideration to invite the doctor was based on the advice of the general practitioner the LHV the GGD and the RIVM The general practitioner went back to work on Monday but as precaution only handles consultations by telephone hour limit deviates from WHO advice However the guidelines of the RIVM do deviate from the advice of the WHO which last week advised that people should remain in isolation for another two weeks after their recovery The hour limit seems arbitrary but according to RIVM spokesperson it is specifically set to relieve the pressure on care in severely affected areas such as Noord Brabant Thanks to this limit care personnel can quickly return to work after an infection It is crucial for RIVM current policy that patients are more contagious the more symptoms they show According to the institute there are indications that the virus can be spread by infected persons without symptoms However it is still unclear what impact this has on the spread of the COVID virus ,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

fkkhv8o, gt The economy is going to tank in either model and we are so intertwined that the lowest common denominator economically will bring the other down Not wrong in general effect but the particulars are very different With lockdown almost all economic activity fails hard simultaneously With controlled infection rates the economic effects are spread out more over time and not all sectors will be equally hit equally badly It is particularly important for national economy that some remnant of it remain functional because it that remnant that will rebuild the rest of it gt Global contagion will mean that no economy can avoid massive recession d argue that how deep and how long the recession depends lot on policy We ve been overdue recession anyway and expect that if anything were likely to precipitate another GFC it might be something like covid Or not Tricky thing is what made the GFC so bad was that debt default was the cause of recession not symptom of it With this default would be symptom of job losses rather than cause the primary cause being viral For as long as the virus continues to be problem so will recession but once the source of the problem is removed the recovery might just might be lot faster than was the case with the GFC In fact d argue that the world economy never did recover from the GFC Not properly And maybe never will gt However in one respect the UK situation will actually be worse economically The effect of widespread sickness that will be sweeping the country Depends on how callous one is willing to be Say we do nothing everyone gets the virus and the mortality rate is That k deaths Sounds pretty horrendous It is But to be callous that about two years worth of net immigration at its peak That a bit more than Sheffield One event that killed the equivalent of the whole of Sheffield would be an eye wateringly shocking event and yet nobody seemed to care that population went up by about half that rate every year so superficially why is it worse to lose population at that rate It be the same in effect albeit less shocking if net immigration inverted to be net emigration That the absolute worst case effect if we did nothing at all Over in the FT comments section speculated whether active management might do more harm than letting nature take its course gt gt gt do wonder which would do more long term damage active management including shutting borders or controls on movement and goods or doing nothing at all gt gt gt Will active management substantially reduce the final death toll given that it is inevitable to become as common and widely distributed as any other cold or flu It is when rather than if and the only choice is infection rate profiles and what economic cost any given authority is willing to pay Again that number of deaths would be both grievous and shocking but in hard economics sudden loss of of the population is probably not nearly so damaging as the effects of extended lockdown that would arrest most industries and destroy others mortality rate is probably lot less Actual number for the UK superficially is currently based on deaths out of known infections It is certain that there are many more unrecorded cases and that perhaps anywhere between in and in are known Wild arsed guess is nice round figure and is excessively optimistic gt Many more people will be hospitalised under the herd immunity model and many will take months to recover Missing very significant percentage of the workforce at various times due to debilitating illness will be devastating That true but lock down has much the same effect economically It also not the variable which the herd immunity effect seeks to optimise gt Lockdown is bad but at least the numbers of infected and unable to work will be much lower It doesn really matter economically if people have to work from home and governments can order that to be done wherever possible It does matter when they cannot work full stop Lockdown isn sustainable long term which means that it only delaying the inevitable And suspect that more jobs can be done remotely than can gt Also in the lockdown model by having much lower numbers of infected overall there is much less chance of those who do need to physically go to work becoming infected hence you afford more protection to critical jobs medical worker supply chain etc That the only real merit to recommend lockdown time to gear up and reining in the critical cases to within limits that the NHS can manage at least until the lockdown period is over If as is being forecast and as happened with the Spanish flu pandemic https www medicinenet com script main art asp articlekey those countries that went into lockdown will see second wave in six months time Maybe the world will be better prepared but the beginnings of recovery after the first wave will be wiped out very quickly gt Do these measures you outlined not counter the UK plan though Probably not One argument says that people ought to be able to make their own risk assessments but that idea doesn acknowledge that one does not risk only one own health but that of unknowable others unless they choose to self isolate Making it easier to self isolate might alter coefficient or two but for that same reason it probably won stop everyone being exposed sooner or later And even the UKG own intention was never to leave this completely to natural processes but choose when to impose increasing restrictions rather than going all out to begin with f the analogy made earlier in pest control if you fire all your guns at once you ve got nothing left when you need second salvo gt The virus needs to go through the population in order for the model to work You shouldn be trying to prevent infection in the younger working population Yes but the model doesn particularly depend on given time frame unless you want to try to build that herd immunity before next winter in which case the programme would have to be sufficiently aggressive as to risk enough lives to defeat the objective if lives lost is your primary concern as presumably it is if one wishes to avoid confronting covid winter possibly WTO trade barriers from Jan gt No home office for the under no home shopping we need you out there in the mixer Which presupposes there negligible intergenerational contact which is certainly not the case gt While it sounds reasonable in the abstract don know if people will be able to take the UK model mentally when it actually happens Right gt Even worse people will know that they are infecting others and in some cases they will infect their own vulnerable relatives That why epidemiology is bastard It just isn as amenable to control as theory suggests which is why lockdown

fkvlkno,Re Training Delivery doesn require an inordinate amount of training m not sure what involve in testing someone for COVID but wrt to cluster identification it a single process so even if it a complex process it can be split into simpler part like production line By training people in parallel to perform their bit in the COVID testing process large numbers could be trained to do this one thing in realistic time frame Perhaps you would get bunch of false negatives but if the process produces one positive result per cluster then you can bring more highly trained people in to contact trace and run more accurate tests on the contacts of the COVID positive case Fordism can also be applied to the manufacturing of PPE e training people to perform relatively simple tasks and joining them together into production line amp B In the past it is true that training people required bring many students or rookies together in the physical presence of teacher Today though you can train people with videos online course and online tests amp B It certainly true that economic activity does run the risk of infection but at the same time we cannot neglect putting food on people plates keeping the water running keeping the electricity and internet working etc etc Building up these vast reserves of delivery people and COVID testers will require activity Again think the best way to ensure the activity does not spread contagion is to ensure that the same people who work together live together That will serve to break up the household workgroup household work group chain of transmission As for the armies of recruits manufacturing PPE so long as they wear the first PPE that they manufacture then hopefully they will not infect each other Or at least the degree to which the PPE they produce stops people from infecting each other is greater than the degree that co workers in PPE production plants infect each other Perhaps an alternative to PPE production plants would be to make PPE cottage industry Where someone would apply to manufacture PPE as part of the containment effort from existing readily available mass produced goods on website Then everyday delivery man would drop the PPE components at the door of volunteers and every evening the volunteers would leave the final assembled PPE pieces outside their door That might be good way to get volunteers to manufacture PPE without compromising on Social Distancing amp B amp B Re Flattening The Curve Situation find it interesting that your criticism of my second point almost directly contradicts your criticism of my first You mentioned problem with building up an army of workers to help in the containment effort takes time and effort and raises the chance of infection on the one hand in your response to training the army of volunteers And yet in your response to flattening the curve you are suggesting that the capacity of the medical system can be increased exponentially at the same rate as the virus provided we dampen down the exponential of the virus If training armies of people to deliver food to people door on short notice is impractical think how much more impractical it will be to train armies of doctors and nurses to treat an exponentially rising number of patients If getting people to manufacture PPE in their own houses with key ingredients delivered to their door could be counterproductive by raising the risk of infection think how much more counterproductive it will be with respect to spreading the infection to bring an exponentially increasing number of rookies volunteers with no or minimal medical training into hospital wards filled with infected patients Think how counterproductive it might be to ask exponentially more people to handle extremely sophisticated medical equipment which they have little training or experience handling Might poorly trained volunteers not end up doing more harm then good if they deliver treatment to patients that are counter productive amp B While is is true that medical equipment will increase with time Skilled medical personnel are on the timescale of the COVID outbreak to all intents and purposes finite amp B Indeed pessimistically it might be even worse If medical personnel start dying the medical capacity might even reduce somewhat If medical personel quit their jobs for fear of their life it could also reduce although don think many will do that but even if of medical personnel neith die nor quit if medical personnel work themselves to exhaustion and suffer burnout which is highly like this would actually tend to reduce the capacity of the healthcare system amp B IMHO it will actually be must easier to recruit manpower into low risk containment related activities delivering food to peoples doors manufacturing PPE maybe even testing saliva samples for COVID could be made low risk is patients post the samples to them or something amp B It will be considerable harder to recruit people to engage in treatment activities which require high level of skills and will involve very high risk to life and limb in workplace that resembles house of horrors ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
ffspnvu,Healthcare workers go in the bunny suits aka the full hazmat suits for few reasons As others have noted in general there are shortages of healthcare workers in many areas even at the best of times and you really don want someone getting sick on the job In the event there are multiple strains going around which doesn seem to be the case for Wuhan CoV but in future could be or can be true for other cruds too you don want those two strains mixing and swapping genetic material through recombination and making potentially nastier hybrid virus Hospital workers also go around in the bunny suits to prevent what called nosocomial infections that is infections spread to people who were not sick with Wuhan CoV but were in hospital for different reasons altogether As amazing as it may sound hospitals with infectious disease wards do all of this for any particularly nasty contagious disease including measles and the chickenpox Yes the children hospital chain in my area we have three children hospitals actually has small infectious disease ward With negative airflow rooms and HEPA filters And staff will go in with bunny suits particularly if it something without good vaccine And yes that includes Dat Flu You know the one Dat Flu In home environment typically you re not veritably marinating yourself in infectious material including droplets coughed by multiple people with the blerg much less Icky Bodily Fluids for upwards of eight to sixteen hours day and the latter is more likely with ER staff many of whom are interns on rotations or during public health emergency like an epidemic You re generally dealing with one to two maybe three sick people You re not dealing with the possibility of multiple strains of the Blerg effectively Having Microbiological Nookie You re generally not having to worry about spreading the crud to others as much And since you re in home environment and you can always Disinfect The Things with some bleach wipes or Lysol you don need to go for the full bunny suit Besides those things are expensive You likely don have clean room where you can pretty much do full change of clothing and someone to help you into and out of said bunny suit hospitals do Now if you DO have pre existing condition like diabetes or asthma or are on cancer chemo or take certain drugs to prevent organ rejection or to manage diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or Crohn Disease yes d do consult with your medical professionals that help you manage this stuff to the effect of What should add to my treatment action plan to prevent Wuhan CoV and what should do if suspect ve contracted it Which is good idea anyways and the advice is probably going to be the same as preventing really bad colds or flu in year where the flu shot isn as effective as usual ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

over years in am now an ICU nurse practitioner dealing with critical illness and life support issues Those of you who have come to me for advice in the past know that am straight shooter and have never bullshitted you on matters of health With that in mind here we go COVID is here In America NOW Circulating in communities both detected and undetected There is no stopping it COVID is respiratory illness caused by SARS CoV new novel is the scientific word strain of coronavirus that has emerged in humans since December It is related to the SARS virus that circulated in We got lucky then Our luck is not so good this time It is not the flu It doesn feel like the flu And it is deadlier than the flu by every measure we have undertaken in affected countries It will make the rounds and many of us will catch it Most of us wont have problem with it however significant number of us will get fairly sick and may need hospitalization of those about half of those hospitalized will likely end up in the ICU and possibly on breathing machines and of those sickest there will be deaths COVID at its best is showing mortality rate which is worse than the flu That is in countries that have extensive testing and detected both the well AND unwell who are positive for the SARS CoV virus which causes the COVID illness There are million folks in america roughly People are throwing around this number of less than one percent Well let me tell you Do the math very small percentage of very large number is STILL large number Symptoms of the Flu involve your body feeling like everything hurts and you got run over by mack truck and you just feel awful in addition to upper respiratory symptoms COVID is different You may or may not have runny nose and fever sore throat becomes major common finding then it gets in the lungs dry nonproductive cough is common followed or accompanied by shortness of breath The shortness of breath is what is triggering hospital visits and the folks presenting to the hospitals show low oxygen levels oxygen saturations and chest imaging typically shows bilateral diffuse pneumonia Double pneumonia for the laypeople The only proven effective therapies are supportive Oxygen and positive pressure ventilation either with cpap bipap machine or with mechanical ventilator attached to breathing tube There is no cure Your body has to fight it off and it has to run its course There is no Tamiflu equivalent that works for this There are some smart medical folks out there spitballing some ideas but nothing is proven to work So like every other viral illness you have gotten you have to ride it out and hope your body is strong enough Babies and children are making out fairly Ok even if they test positive they havent been dying of it in China in Italy however healthy young adults even athletic types in their s are coming in very sick and some are dying From there the older one is the higher the hospitalization rates and the mortality rates Information out of China shows that it was killing men more than women but one thing to note is that in China older men are invariably tobacco smokers Information out of Italy appears to show the obese are having worse time with it In general blood pressure and diabetes are associated with higher rates of severe illness and death In particular people takeing ACE Inhibitors or ARB for their blood pressure the drugs ending in pril like lisinopril or sartan like valsartan seem to be having worse time This makes sense since both of these classes of medicine affect cells in the lungs which SARS CoV is thought to also affect The biggest danger right now and the reason why am writing this and tagging you is that this will explode here like it has in Italy Iran and how it did in China We only have so many hospital beds We only have so many ICU beds We only have so many ventilators and we only have so many trained staff who can care for the patients If this blows up massively beyond the ability of the health care system to treat and rescue patients people who COULD have lived will simply die In italy they have an excellent national healthcare system with about ICU beds and per capita have more doctors and hospital beds than we do here in the US Of course the US is bigger and has more total beds and ventilators but again less per capita In italy in Lombardy the state province and in Milan they have simply run out of ventilators Doctors are faced with having too many people who cant breathe anymore and not enough breathing machines to put them on They are literally deciding on the spot who might live and who will die They aren doing CPR or anything else futile for the COVID patients They dont have the staff or capacity to do so There a lot more horrible stuff could tell you about whats happening but the short version is this if we exceed the capacity to manage this people who should have lived will die Which brings us to here now in the US COVID is here It WILL sweep the nation There was never anything we could have done to stop it because of the way we live and conduct business BUT what we have to do is SLOW IT DOWN IF we SLOW IT DOWN so that the number of unwell and critically ill dont explode and overwhelm the system then everyone has fighting chance Give time for flu season to end and get flu patients out of the hospital Give time for the first wave of Covid patients to get well enough to get out of the hospital So to SLOW IT DOWN practice frequent handwashing Dont touch your face nose or eyes without washing your hands first Frequently disinfect common surfaces PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING COVID LOVES CROWD If you are gonna spread this disease around lets spread it to only one or two people not people at time Stay away from large groups Lets lay off the rodeos the ball games the big parties the night clubs Do small groups or stay home If you go out and touch common surfaces clean your hands before touching your face On bus in china one person gave it to other people including one who got on mins after the index case left the bus If you are sick stay home Dont visit other vulnerable folks If it gets in your household accept that its there and try not to give it to your aunts uncles and grandparents Stay home dont go to school For the elders reading this need you to stay home as if your life depends on it Because it very well does Your age group is the one having the worst time with this And if it gets bad all can say is that in Italy this week if you were crashing and over they didn even consider offering vent to them So please elders Stay home skip church avoid visiting large numbers of people Skip the lodge meeting And if you are adamant that your wings will not be clipped then please make sure your will is updated and you ve given copy to your kids Now none of this says panic or buy bottled water and toilet paper m asking for everyone to take deep breath and be smart Quit caring about your In year or two it will be back The airlines and cruise lines will get bailed out The economy is going to tank no matter what so quit worrying about it Right now the decision is do we want tanked economy with low body count or high body count We are all in this together Wash your hands Cover your mouth Practice social distancing Stay away from large crowds Be smart Stay home if sick Dont hoard or steal medical supplies We need them desperately at the hospital ,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

fho3a5r,What is Virus Scientists at USAMRID the S Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious diseases work with some of the most deadly forms of life on earth killer viruses Learn more Some viruses are picky about which door they choose but others are little more promiscuous They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells says Anna Suk Fong Lok assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon and those infections appear to flourish in the gut potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea But Frieman says we don know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same Researchers believe COVID uses the same receptor as SARS and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines Two studies one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving cases have also detected the virus in stool samples which might indicate the virus could spread via feces But this is far from conclusive Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus we don know at all Frieman says But it definitely looks like it there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this Blood storm Coronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier study showed that percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs In fact signs of full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses elevated liver enzymes lower white blood cell and platelet count and low blood pressure In rare cases patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest But this isn necessarily sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body says Angela Rasmussen virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health It might be cytokine storm Basically you re bleeding out of your blood vessels Angela Rasmussen virologist Cytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons they recruit immune cells to the site of infection The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in bid to save the rest of the body Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing threat But during runaway coronavirus infection when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation this culling becomes free for all Rasmussen says Instead of shooting at target with gun you re using missile launcher she says That where the problem arises Your body is not just targeting the infected cells It is attacking healthy tissue too The implications extend outside the lungs Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs Basically you re bleeding out of your blood vessels Rasmussen says The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs From there things can take sharp turn for the worse In some of the most severe COVID cases the cytokine response combined with diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body can result in multi organ failure Scientists don know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes Even if the virus doesn get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes Frieman says And that when things can get serious Today sPopular Stories ScienceStarstruck The first person to see the Pale Blue Dot image still has it stashed in her closet Animals World largest cave fish discovered in India Science huge iceberg just broke off West Antarctica most endangered glacier Liver Collateral damage When zoonotic coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS MERS and COVID often mild though more severe cases have led to severe liver damage and even liver failure So what happening Once virus gets into your bloodstream they can swim to any part of your body Lok says The liver is very vascular organ so coronavirus can very easily get into your liver Your liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats Your liver also contains enzymes which speed up chemical reactions in the body In normal body Lok explains liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day Because of that regeneration process the liver can withstand lot of injury When you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood though as has been common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS it a warning sign It might be mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe even liver failure Lok says scientists don completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver The virus might be directly infecting the liver replicating and killing off the cells itself Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body immune response to the virus sets off severe inflammatory reaction in the liver ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
fkwut7j,If supportive care alone isn sufficient then experimental use of these drugs is the common treatment right now Sometimes alone more often in combination from the research have been reading With the already approved drugs used off label to treat COVID all that is required is patient or patient proxy consent as the drugs are already approved for medical use Most will also be asked sometimes retrospectively if their case data can be used as part of clinical trial data for use in analysis later which can then become part of the body of evidence that these drugs are indeed effective What will currently be lacking is the size of the control group the severely with COVID that may benefit from these drugs but are not given them mostly patient refusal currently as currently if your only option is Chloroquine and Supportive ICU care or very likely worsening disease and death most consent to Chloroquine even though it isn approved for that indication and the evidence for safety and efficient is not as large as yet as would be normally needed for approval For unapproved drugs like Remdesivir compassionate use authorisation and consent are needed making its use much less common as there isn a great supply of it and qualifying for compassionate use requires meeting set of criteria that not everyone that may benefit from it can meet Anything saying success rate should not be taken as confirmatory proof of efficacy Samples are still to small and those sort of statements would have to be combined with what sort of condition the patients treated were in to begin with And also no it doesn mean that we re saving of COVID patients because of the efficacy of some drug treatment it also is not in any way connected to the published rate of cases being classed as severe nor those ending in death vs recovery Any paper regarding specified drug treatment for COVID right now is simply communicating how cases progressed when these drugs were used They don indicate that the drugs were curative or disease modifying as there is no way to determine how many of the patients treated experimentally with drugs would not have recovered spontaneously However the more examples of cases you collect with patients in similar conditions where the group treated had lower mortality rate than the group given no antiviral drugs adds to the body of evidence for the specified drugs that they were partly responsible for that lower mortality rate should it be lower And as with all scientific literature there are biases Particularly when problem needs solution as quickly as possible There is more pressure to publish when the report can be written presenting data as showing that the experimental drug treatments lessened disease length and or severity reduced morbidity and or mortality and even very low sample size case reports of one or two critically ill COVID ventilator ECMO dependent patients being brought back from the bring of death very rapidly once drug treatment was initiated So you ll see lot of positive confirmation bias around drugs that do have an positive effect against SARS CoV It not the best science but it not totally without use and until better double blind controlled trials are available which can be partially completed during the outbreak with severe restriction on control groups and the double blinding it these case reports that are guiding the production of preliminary treatment protocols all around the world Read any country current guidelines for pharmacotherapy in COVID and you ll see referenced case reports of low numbers of patients given Chloroquine and Kaletra while in the ICU on renal replacement and ventilated rather than large controlled trials also including healthy controls as that mainly all we currently have So these positive outcomes shouldn be ignored but their guiding of treatment for large groups will be replaced with better studies once available which will also provide better evidence as to the efficacy of these drugs and the rates of efficacy such as something that resembles success rate Data from better trials will show differences between drug treated and untreated COVID patients if they exist for particular drug treatment They will include many more data points large sample sizes such as differences in mortality rates rate of reduction of viral load viral load vs time in treated and untreated CRP level vs time in treated and untreated patients Other trends may be present which one may be able to find from larger studies such as differences in drug efficacy between age groups sex combined with other drugs combined with comorbidities Statistical analysis of the data will then allow reports to be produced to show if and how significant the changes to the measured and recorded clinical attributes blood results data obtained upon physical examination etc are Do this correctly and in manner that can be repeated and you build body of evidence for particular drug treatment that increases confidence that correlation between improvement in clinical condition and use of new drug regiment is indicative of causation With all the clinical data present probable confirmation on the downstream effects of mechanism of action if you know from in vitro work that drug inhibits an enzyme required for viral replication and patients that receive it have their viral load inversely correlated with time using of the drug and the rate of decrease is much greater in patients using the drug you start to build better quantitative picture of efficacy as one example You can also use these data combined with drug dose given as an independent variable in order to determine the optimal dose for each age group or minimal dose required to treat which could be and very probably is different for COVID than malaria So be very wary of wide reaching statements during this early stage especially those that state things like cure and success rates with no explanation of how that number was calculated and from data from what sample of patients were used to generate it and the number in that sample and of course whether the process has been peer reviewed and repeated by other medics scientists healthcare providers TL DR Use of these drugs experimentally is already common in severe cases as it all we have to use there aren yet any specific SARS CoV antiviral drugs success rate with drug doesn mean that we are currently saving of patients with COVID because of that drug There is not yet enough data to provide any success rate type statistics or even change in mortality rate statistics for any drug used in COVID patients but there are many interesting and encouraging case reports where drugs have been used against SARS CoV which are being used to generate preliminary guidelines for clinical practice and will guide the construction of larger current and future studies that will show how confident we can be that any of these treatments can be relied upon to treat COVID and then which are better than others by comparing different drug treatments that all positively treat the disease with each other Then we will have evidence for which treatments work the correct doses to use which are most toxic have more side effects which are more or less appropriate in special populations in pregnancy users of other meds etc and in which cases drug treatment is effective against the disease in some cases those currently classed as severe for example something else we need universal definition for but didn statistically significantly change the outcome in others ie when use of antiviral drug treatment which does work is required or appropriate at all ve probably missed lot out but there some useful info in there One could write and there exist many large texts on how to construct and run clinical trial that produces high enough quantity and quality data that can be used to produce evidence to guide clinical practice You also get the picture of why it all takes much time financial investment and dedicated personnel to do correctly Drugs are very expensive because of profiteering but they re normally expensive and time consuming to discover and prove safe and effective because of all the above and more ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
fl140d3,I hate crying in public But there was weeks pregnant with my first child with tears streaming down my face as stood among crowd of anxious shoppers in Long Beach Target had tried to push down that all too familiar lump that rises in my throat before the tears began but mix of hormones and coronavirus induced anxiety proved too much My colleagues at The Times have written extensively about the apprehension surrounding the outbreak including people flocking to stores to stockpile food and other essentials So when my husband and walked into the store that day we expected certain aisles would be empty didn anticipate nearly all the infant Tylenol would be gone In complete panic but still months away from my due date picked up one of the last boxes on the shelf in an attempt to find some sense of control My husband looked at me with confusion as unleashed string of irrational fears He countered kindly that perhaps the medicine should be saved for family with sick baby at home Of course he was right pictured panicked new mother searching for medication for her child and finding none among the sea of empty shelves put the box back That when the tears started Pregnancy in the time of coronavirus seems especially cruel Pregnancy though joyous is filled with so much unspoken anxiety in the best of times Am eating the right food Am drinking too much caffeine Will my baby be healthy Will be good mother Coronavirus adds another question into the mix What happens if get sick ADVERTISEMENT SCIENCE If become infected with the coronavirus what are my odds of survival March Dr Neil Silverman clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA has heard similar questions at his practice from many worried mothers to be It all about the fact that there so many things in the setting of pregnancy that women have no control over Silverman said during recent phone interview Women especially in their first pregnancy are understandably concerned in general about all the things that cannot go according to plan There is little data available on how the coronavirus which causes respiratory illness known as COVID affects pregnant women Women experience physiological changes during pregnancy that can weaken their immune systems and place them at higher risk for severe complications if exposed to viruses especially if they have underlying heath conditions Past studies have shown that pregnant women who contract influenza are at higher risk for severe complications and in women who contracted N the swine flu during pregnancy also became sicker than non pregnant women according to Dr Denise Jamieson chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine in Georgia Still doctors said that researchers have not seen early signals suggesting an increased risk of complications or birth defects associated with pregnant women and fetuses exposed to the coronavirus Pregnant women can become severely ill but think pregnant women should be reassured as there doesn seem to be related birth defects like we saw with Zika Jamieson said during phone call last week These are scary times and think lot of people including pregnant women are afraid Luckily this is not virus that seems to disproportionately affect pregnant women They can take solace in that ADVERTISEMENT In recent study published in the Lancet researchers followed nine pregnant women who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Wuhan China the epicenter of the outbreak during their third trimester Researchers found that none of the infants all delivered via caesarean had the virus at birth There also was no evidence of the virus in the mothers breast milk cord blood or amniotic fluid according to the study The new mothers had experienced the same symptoms as nonpregnant women the study showed with fever in seven cough in four myalgia in three and sore throat and malaise in two They developed pneumonia but none of the cases were considered severe Researchers suggest these data indicate that mothers diagnosed with COVID do not pass along the virus to their unborn babies through the placenta However it is possible for mothers to pass the virus to infants after birth from respiratory droplets or particles that leave the mouth or nose when sick person coughs sneezes or talks While the virus has not been detected in breast milk the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it still not clear whether the virus can be transmitted to infants during feedings The CDC recommends infected mothers wash their hands before touching their babies and wearing face mask if possible while breastfeeding Another option is having healthy person feed expressed breast milk to the infant Health officials are urging pregnant women along with the elderly and others with weakened immune systems to do their best to avoid exposure to the coronavirus Doctors suggest staying home as much as possible avoiding crowds including long lines at supermarkets and other stores and staying away from emergency rooms And of course frequent hand washing Dr Karin Nielsen Saines professor of clinical pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at UCLA Children Hospital suggests women reach out to their doctors to see if routine labs or physical assessments can be done without visit to clinics or hospitals to limit their risk of exposure Some doctors including mine have already instituted this practice The Kaiser Permanente in Gardena was nearly empty when arrived Wednesday afternoon for monthly exam and ultrasound Medical staff wearing paper gowns masks and gloves screened patients for symptoms of the virus before they walked in the front door ADVERTISEMENT was one of few people that day who had to physically visit the office because had to have blood drawn Get in and out quickly nurse told me as she placed sticker allowing my entry into the building on my blouse Another woman who was having an ultrasound was video chatting with her husband who was stuck in the lobby during the exam The medical center has stopped allowing visitors in exam rooms in an effort to help protect patients and staff members from the spread of the illness similar visitor policy also extends to hospitals when women are giving birth Kaiser will allow one visitor typically spouse or partner for the duration of woman hospital stay But family and friends are being asked to wait until the new parents are at home to meet their bundle of joy Hoag Hospital in Orange County has also instituted the one visitor policy Despite the new restrictions and disappointments especially for women whose baby shower plans and babymoon trips have been thwarted by the virus Nielsen Saines emphasized the importance of keeping to

fib7t9m, DeepL translation The coronavirus crisis has escalated this Friday to several levels in Italy Fourteen people tested positive in the town of Codogno southeast of Milan and two others in Padua in the Veneto region according to the latest information These are the first known cases of transmission by contagion of this disease in the country This situation has led to the compulsory quarantine of about people and the isolation of ten neighbouring towns with total of about inhabitants In addition the regional government has forced the closure of all public premises and has recommended that the inhabitants do not leave their homes in the next few hours The medical alarm has also been triggered by the lack of clarity regarding the source of the infection and the epidemiological link that would allow the disease to be isolated amp B The first case detected was that of year old Italian man from Castiglione Adda The patient was hospitalised on Wednesday but initially no clear connection to China was established and it was ruled out that the symptoms could be related to the disease When his situation worsened and he had to be transferred to the intensive care unit his wife gave the alert that activated the protocol the man had met several times with friend who had recently returned from China But the clue was more puzzling amp B The meetings between the two occurred many more days after his return from the Asian country More than the that establish the duration of the incubation process and that could hide the symptoms In addition when the potential carrier of the virus was tested he tested negative The man remains hospitalized for further testing but he never had any symptoms and if he actually contracted the virus his infection could be over by now health authorities suggested The worst case scenario hence the alarm raised in the region is that the epidemiological link would have been lost amp B The wife who is eight months pregnant was one of those who tested positive for the coronavirus as was man who had played sports with it The rest of the infections did not in principle have direct contact with the year old man Three customers from bar in Codogno the main focus of the infection in Lombardy all arrived at the local hospital between Thursday and Friday night with significant cases of pneumonia which made it possible to detect the positives The patients are men and women all around years old The only thing we know is that they all live in the same area said Giulio Gallera regional health coordinator However eight other people in Lombardy were added to the list of infections including five doctors and three patients from the Codogno hospital where the first people to contract the virus were treated amp B The environment of the man who was first infected has been isolated The patient works at an Italian branch of Unilever while the friend who made the trip to China is manager at MAE an Italian producer of synthetic fibres Among those who should be quarantined are the year old co workers family members and the doctors and nurses who treated him in the hospital The emergency room that initially treated the year old man has also been closed amp B The regional government has decided to close schools administrative buildings and bars and restaurants in ten villages for one week In addition it has asked people not to leave their homes It is necessary to immediately isolate the areas where the virus has developed in order to contain it said Lombardy Civil Protection Commissioner Pietro Foroni We must not spread panic but we must make people understand that the measures taken are essential for the good of the community said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the head of the National Civil Protection Agency Angelo Borrelli went to Lombardy this afternoon for crisis meeting with local authorities ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
fk1lsdt,On Day of Lockdown Italian Officials Urge Citizens to Abide by Rules Italy prime minister implored the public to cooperate in the largest clampdown against the coronavirus in the Western world We are the new Wuhan one Milan resident said broad lockdown has begun in Italy in response to the coronavirus which included tourist attractions shutting down and virtual mass from Pope Francis By Jason Horowitz and Emma Bubola Published March Updated March m ET ROME Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ended his m news conference to announce the extraordinary lockdown of Italy north with plea that other heads of state may not have felt compelled to make We must understand that we all must stick to and we must not counteract these measures he urged in the early hours of Sunday morning We must not try and be clever Mr Conte had just decreed series of measures that amounted to the largest clampdown against the coronavirus outbreak in the Western world restricting the movement of about quarter of Italy population and jeopardizing its economy But unlike China where the outbreak began this is democracy and debate erupted immediately over how well the government will be able to enforce the new rules and whether Italians will actually obey them We are the new Wuhan said Elena Lofino who works in shopping center in the closed off northern region of Lombardy referring to the locked down Chinese city of million people where the virus is believed to have originated As she hung out with her friends Ms Lofino said she thought the measures made sense It going to be huge sacrifice she said but we ll accept it By The New York Times Hours after the prime minister announced the new restrictions Italy death toll from the virus jumped by more than percent in single day to from on Saturday the most deaths officially reported for any country outside China Italy has the worst outbreak in Europe with more than known to be infected Many including Mr Conte have appealed to Italians to reject their tendency toward furbizia the Italian word for the sort of cunning or cleverness typically channeled into getting around bureaucracy and inconvenient laws Furbizia to be sure is broad brush character trait ascribed to Italians often by other Italians But on Sunday it seemed to be front of mind as travelers rushed onto trains out of Lombardy before the decree went into effect in the afternoon and as health experts and officials implored the public to abide by the law and act responsibly You need to stay home Barbara Balanzoni doctor said in video that went viral in Italy She said there were not enough respirators to help people sick from the virus There are too many people walking around Dr Balanzoni protested As museums closed across the country Italy culture minister Dario Franceschini thanked the many protagonists of music cinema and show business who promoted on social media the m Staying Home hashtag It a very important message for our youth he wrote on Twitter In Rome outside the locked down red zones farther north the authorities recommended that people limit their movements to only what is strictly necessary Valeria Graziussi Neapolitan living in Rome said she and her friends had decided to do an experiment On Sunday she went for an afternoon coffee at the Caf Sant Eustachio one of the city best known cafes which is usually packed You rarely get to stand at the counter for more than seconds she said Ms Graziussi still found lines to get served at the counter and so considered the experiment success We haven been terrorized enough her friend Davide Andrea said with shrug The Italian authorities have consistently taken some of the most aggressive steps to stop the virus spread They have canceled flights from China in January quarantining entire towns in February and now severely limiting movement in all of Lombardy home to the economic powerhouse Milan as well as in swaths of other nearby regions and iconic cities like Venice That has not been enough for some European officials The Czech prime minister Andrej Babis said on Sunday that Italy should ban all its citizens from traveling to Europe In Italy critics said the calls for civic duty were undercut by confusion They said that contradictory messages from the government and from officials of the northern regions about what people could do and where they could go were not helping They also criticized the national government in Rome for schizophrenia that vacillates between drop everything alerts and just wash your hands reassurances While Prime Minister Conte said Italians were obligated to stay put in the demarcated northern areas unless they had been granted permission to pass through police checkpoints the Lombardy official running the region response to the crisis said it was not so strict Giulio Gallera the Lombardy region top health care official said in Facebook live post that the decree signed overnight by Mr Conte had fostered doubts among citizens Mr Gallera suggested that citizens to preserve the country economy should be able to move around for work And he said the national government should clear up any confusion on the matter Matteo Salvini the leader of Italy opposition league party echoed the sentiment Clarity clarity clarity he said in statement Who can do what Where can you go What can you bring In the days before the decree old men outside the quarantined town Zorlesco joked that their friends often sidestepped the rules and eluded the police checkpoints by taking old country roads to the bar for drink outside the locked down area In the country southern regions the governors say that anyone arriving from locked down northern areas should go into quarantine Giuseppe Ippolito the director of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome declared on Italian television that the people who fled last night are potential risk for the country He urged them to contact the health services report their situation and be ready for eventual isolation Some people thought they were doing the right thing by leaving Milan for the south At Milan Central train station early Sunday morning Giorgia Caredda year old social media manager waited for train to Rome so that she could help take care of her father who has heart problems in case something bad happens One side of me feels really silly she said about being prompted to leave by sense of impending doom got this sensation of being chained and needed to get out The authorities in the Lazio region where the regional president on Saturday said he had contracted the virus posted on Facebook pictures of busy squares and streets in Rome with wecantdothis caption In Luigi Barzini classic study of his countrymen The Italians he attributed the value put on furbizia to Italy habit of being conquered and governed by long line of hated foreigners or quislings from Napoleon to the Hapsburgs Image checkpoint in the quarantined town Zorlesco Credit Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times Under the surface the Italians invented ways to defeat oppressive regimentation Mr Barzini wrote As they could not protect their national liberty in the field of battle they fought strenuously to defend the liberty of the individual and his family the only liberty they understood anyway The writer compared the rules those leaders imposed to the hedges in steeplechase course that Italians used to show off their speed Laws he said became necessary evil if only because they provided the delight of evading them How could one circumvent laws if there were none he wrote This is precisely the kind of thinking that Mr Conte urged Italians to avoid We must safeguard our health he said early Sunday and that of those we love In some unlikely quarters that message seemed to be breaking through Antonio Ponti D in Milan club scene had planned party in defiance of the crackdown on the city night life To skirt an ordinance against events in venues that don allow people to keep meter distance from one another he cleverly planned the party outdoors But as the toll of virus grew and talk of tough restrictions resonated in Milan he said he did not want to be seen as plague spreader He followed the lead of other promoters and pulled the plug It is wiser he said if we help things get better Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome Jason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief covering Italy the Vatican Greece and other parts of Southern Europe He previously covered the presidential campaign the Obama administration and Congress with an

cv24b0n,What do we do with these conflicts It very tempting to ignore them Let the latest round of religious violence sort itself out see what fanatical dictator emerges and bribe him to get some of that tasty oil We can pat ourselves on the back because this time we didn get involved in local politics that weren our business and we let those third world folks choose their own form of government and figure things out for themselves Nobody has to feel guilty about drone strikes or get called arrogant because we held ourselves above the conflict which is of course just as arrogant as wading in thinking you can fix everything but at least you don get called arrogant for disdaining to act Yet then come all the distressing reports during the violent times of genocides chemical warfare sex trafficking slavery mass killings torture etc etc etc of all the old Sectarian hatreds flaring up until the region is engulfed in war of everyone versus everyone And you do kind of have to wonder how history is going to look back on the world that saw all this shit going down and shrugged apathetic pausing only to ask when the oil would resume flowing And you have to ask yourself how long it ll be before someone looks outward for an enemy one that could unite lot of people under his or her war banner And you have the floods of refugees who re going to want to escape to safer countries as long as there a war on whether or not the West is staying out of it maybe that ll be good for the economy maybe not We ll have to see on that one Point is there re compelling reasons to want to promote stability in the region which means intervening in some way But how do you stop conflict like the endless Middle Eastern clusterfuck in which each war is only the latest in long series of battles Well an Iraqi friend once told me that his personal plan for Peace in the Mid East was to and quote glass everything True he may have played too much WH for his own good but it does kind of sum up what Gordian knot the whole mess is and how tempting it is to want magic bullet or Alexander the Great sword to solve all the problems simple direct solution Well frankly if you re expecting someone on Reddit to have even complicated perfect answer you re probably deluding yourself For instance the idea of education as miracle cure for radicalism You begin to build school Islamists militants shoot at you Boko Haram The school is done Islamists shoot at it Kids come Islamists shoot at them pour acid on them kidnap and rape them Kids stop coming Islamists continue to shoot at the school Nobody is getting educated Islamists continue to shoot things Okay well maybe bring in some soldiers to go raid the Islamists let the kids feel safe coming to learn It works they re dead good job But each one has five brothers and thirty cousins in and around the valley who now maybe want to shoot at you several of them are the same age as your students but you don have to be to wear suicide vest Now hear that this eventually began to work in Afghanistan but m not sure that means it would work throughout the region as whole because it not as simple as Westerners versus Islamists with peace loving folks caught in the middle not when you expand your scope to the whole Middle East There re too many fuckin cooks you see To solve the Middle East as whole you have to deal with whole shitton of different factions that have been trying to wipe one another out for centuries and none of them really like you that much they ll use you when you re convenient and use their death squads when you aren And then of course you have Israel sitting there hoping desperately that none of these bastards ever wield influence or buddy up long enough to take swing at them and maybe Israel isn relying solely on hope either Also it political suicide to cross them because they spend king ransom on buying your representatives loyalty Also they can help but piss off everyone in the region Meanwhile Russia is nosing around for any old scraps of Soviet glory they might ve left behind the last time they were in the Middle East you know before Rambo kicked them out with the help of the brave Mujaheddin Meanwhile your soldiers and aid workers are being killed and the public is getting sick of apparently shoveling good money after bad to no obvious effect Meanwhile there another genocide happening in Africa Meanwhile North Korea finally worked up the balls to start nuclear war Meanwhile China and Japan are sniping at each other and threatening an islandhopping campaign and it looks like South Korea wants in too assuming it not still fighting North Korea Meanwhile Eastern Europe caught on fire again Meanwhile Mexico just became police state cartel state both Meanwhile Canada maple syrup reserves went missing Meanwhile we are giving serious thought to establishing colony on Mars in the near future and what will the Russians think of that Meanwhile Australia opened up its first literal death camp for immigrants and doesn see what all the fuss is about Meanwhile Shi ite and Sunni refugees from the endless war in the Middle East are demanding housing in separate districts because they ve been in peaceful country for while and have remembered old grudges Meanwhile global warming is displacing millions of coastal and island dwelling peoples killing crops and ravaging small economies Meanwhile increased automation in the workforce has predictably done nothing but line the pockets of the ultrawealthy and unemployment is skyrocketing Meanwhile Kanye West just became the POTUS Meanwhile everyone too distracted by the latest round of culture wars to summon up the political will to deal with anything but whether or not gendering characters in assigned reading is transmisogynistic Meanwhile the fucking neo Nazis are back and they re mainstream now Meanwhile all of Los Angeles just fell into the Pacific Ocean Meanwhile scandals Meanwhile bird flu and swine flu hurricanes and meltdowns Malaria and polio resurgence AI research Red carpet gaffs Firefly reboot Steam goes offline SOPA and PIPA and the TPPIPPIPITTPIPI Ice nine There will always be other things to worry about and even America doesn have the resources or will to do it all America probably doesn have the resources to even hold the whole Middle East for an entire generation worth of education and say even like that be such small feat when it be anything but Until people decide to stop killing one another the killing will continue That is the only simple truth and it is pretty much worthless because if history is anything to go by we quite like killing one another or at least we always forget that we hate it And what more everything in this post is horrifying oversimplification Because again you re fuckin nuts if you think someone on Reddit is slinging anything but snake oil TL DR m saying nothing with feeling ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fjkilsx,So think where the messaging is failing is that it focuses on mild and death cases only The larger issue for our healthcare system is that out of people who get sick with Covid will end up with severe disease meaning at home with aggressive care e visiting nurse and or oxygen or hospitalized One third of hospitalized pts will end up in the ICU This would overrun our hospitals in terms of available beds available ICU rooms and ventilators Before this disease hospitals basically run at full or capacity meaning pts wait in the ER for the next available bed On top of that there will be doctors and nurses on quarantine leading to understaffing and clearly some staff will not come in to work due to fear which we are already seeing This is what happened in Wuhan Hospitals could not deal with the huge jump in severely sick pts many of which would not die if they had adequate care So anything that can slow the spread of the disease self quarantine cancelled events strict hygiene will help our hospitals remain effective for those who are sick Panickers focus on fear of death deniers focus on mild cases neither of these attitudes are helpful More people need to understand that we need to focus on trying not to overburden our hospitals and clinics e staying home if they are mildly ill basically self quarantine for the greater good Don go to your clinic or ER with mild symptoms You ll clog up the system when self quarantine and typical self care for cold is all you need Edits for grammar typos Edit to add What many don know is that hospitals are already cancelling elective surgeries to make more ventilators available for the ICU lot of these people who need ventilators will not die But if they don get ventilator they will die So if your elective surgery gets postponed months be cool with that ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

from entering the country In Hong Kong South Korea and Vietnam businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome In France front page headline in regional newspaper warned of Yellow Alert And in suburb of Toronto parents demanded that school district keep children of family that had recently returned from China out of classes for days The rapid spread of the coronavirus that has sickened about people the overwhelming majority in China with all of the deaths there has unleashed wave of panic and in some cases outright anti Chinese sentiment across the globe While officials scramble to contain the crisis the World Health Organization declared global health emergency and the State Department issued do not travel to China advisory fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia And the wave of spreading panic has at times far outstripped practical concerns At time when China rise as global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion said Kristi Govella an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii Manoa Some of the response to the outbreak can be seen as rational calculation based on the risk of infection Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan the center of the epidemic and other Chinese cities and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend Late Thursday Italy prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China And countries like Malaysia the Philippines Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province where Wuhan is situated or China altogether think it is time

Chinese Yaeko Suenaga server said she understood why some stores might want to reject visitors from China don think this fear comes from discrimination Ms Suenaga said but from the true fear that humans have of getting infected with virus that may lead to death Ms Suenaga said that her restaurant would continue to welcome all customers but that workers would wear masks It is not always easy to

fkv3fnj, Countless Countries Are Evacuating Nationals from China Whereas annual flu toxicity is adjudicated by modeling case numbers and by sophisticated and learned guesses at the number of likely infections so far the death rate of the coronavirus is calibrated bit differently apparently predicated both on known deaths and known cases When we make facile comparisons between the flu and coronaviruses they may prove valid but for now it still wise to remember that annual flu cases could be fewer than what is guessed at through modeling each year and corona infections may be higher than the current known numbers of confirmed positives The former reality might mean that the flu is at times little more lethal than we think and the corona virus little less deadly That is not to suggest that most strains of flu are as lethal as the coronavirus only that for the vast majority of Americans the current S COVID case to fatality ratio of percent may eventually prove less and influenza commonly cited lethality rate may prove higher In any case percent of Americans may well recover from the coronavirus rate that is not typical of most of history plagues amp B The realities are paradoxical If the coronavirus infects as many Americans as an average flu strain then ten times more Americans could die mostly over the age of even as the vast majority of all Americans will not Statistics change hourly but the CDC as of the afternoon of March reports that there are currently cases of known coronavirus infections and deaths attributed to the virus or about two deaths per infected the majority of them again likely over amp B To the degree that we are suffering death and economic hurt from COVID we can also attribute the toll to the Chinese Communist Party Had it just called in the international medical community in late November instituted early quarantines and allowed its own citizens to use email and social media to apprise and warn others of the new disease then the world and the S would probably not have found themselves in the current panic The reasons China did not act more responsibly may be inherent in communist governments or they may involve more Byzantine causes left to be disclosed amp B Add in the proximity of Level virology lab nearby Ground Zero of COVID which fueled Internet conspiracy theories the weird rumors about quite strange animals such as snakes and pangolins birthing the infection in primeval open meat markets stocked with live animals in filthy conditions in cages and pirated videos of supposed patients dropping comatose in crowded hospital hallways With all of that we had the ingredients of Hollywood zombie movie adding to the frenzy amp B Plus is an election year echoing how the swine flu was politicized The Left and its media appendages saw COVID as able to do what John Brennan James Clapper James Comey and Andrew McCabe the Mueller team and impeachment could not destroy the hated Trump presidency amp B China will rue what it begat amp B That is it will come to appreciate fully that the supposed efficiency ruthlessness and autocracy of the Communist Party what had so impressed foolish American journalists who once marveled at Beijing ability to enact by fiat liberal pet projects such as high speed rail and solar industries were China worst enemies ensuring that the virus would spread and that China international reputation would be ruined amp B The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the proverbial back of the Chinese camel stooped under the recent weight of trade war with the S the revelation of million Uighurs in reeducation camps the crackdown on Hong Kong democracy protesters and news of the sprawling Chinese internal surveillance apparat The world is now both terrified and put off by China and such anathemas will only harm its already suspect and misbegotten Silk Road neocolonial schemes amp B Here in the S COVID will create bipartisan pressure to adopt policies of keeping key S industries such as medical supplies pharmaceuticals and military applied high tech in America Americans will not again wish to outsource the vast majority of their chemotherapy drug antibiotic and heart medicine production to government that cannot be trusted and that sees such globalized output as weapon to be used in extremis amp B Although we cannot see it now spin off effects from the panic and frenzy will eventually fuel more economic recovery Oil prices are nearing record modern lows ensuring cheap gas for spring and summer American drivers Cheap mortgages and car loans

fgv84xf,This definitely has some merit If true this would mean the total death count is about When compared to the official number of infected China has claimed rest of the world about that make the fatality rate something like Of course that seems far too high which tells us China is definitely lying about the number of infected d be willing to bet the actual fatality rate is about Same as SARS Because that what this thing is SARS Something haven seen mentioned at all In reality the Wuhan Coronavirus is sibling of SARS which is itself coronavirus They re extremely close Not just extremely they re basically fucking identical The only real difference is in couple proteins which changes how it binds to cells which changes the way it spreads between humans But the way they enter the cell and everything after that replicating in the cell etc is identical SARS itself is incredibly lethal and dangerous with fatality rate of which rises to in the elderly However like most fatal infections SARS has limited spread and thus never became big issue Diseases like that usually kill hundreds and then burn themselves out They aren able to start massive pandemics like flu is able to However this seems different This seems like it spreading incredibly fast That combined with the overwhelming evidence that this is man made makes everything fall into place Basically what happened was high level biowarfare lab had the idea of taking extremely fatal yet not readily spreadable infectious diseases and altering them in order to make them able to spread fast like flu That why this Wuhan coronavirus has some weird HIV inserts and some other seemingly random changes Yet fundamentally it identical to SARS and they re mostly the same virus This could be very bad If it even has mortality rate then we re fucked It will kill lot of people This could potentially be super SARS SARS with the same lethality but the rate of infection Like said the only real difference between SARS and this coronavirus is how they initially bind to the cell The coronavirus has new protein which seems to allow it to bind to alveolar cells meaning the lungs This means the lungs have now become prime entrance for this virus coughing can spread it effectively now too Like said nearly the same virus except for few key and intelligently designed differences ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

fk6doh5,Google translate Today another state in the United States has declared state of emergency and the state of Florida in the United States has declared state of public health emergency The governor office of Florida has announced that the state has found two confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia and need to wait for further confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control The two are being treated in isolation This is the third state in the United States to declare state of emergency after California and Washington states It can be seen that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has shown signs of sparking fire in the United States and after the first case of new crown pneumonia deaths was announced in the United States yesterday today There has been one death from neocoronary pneumonia and total of two deaths have occurred However it is ridiculous that the United States now needs to confirm new case of new pneumonia in the United States and it needs final review by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention This is why Florida is very dissatisfied with this It was declared state of emergency Obviously the true outbreak of new coronary pneumonia in the United States has been seriously underestimated The reason is that all confirmed cases must be finally identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which has made the United States data always suspicion worldwide As the S crown pneumonia epidemic is getting more and more serious Trump has also kept coming out to let the Americans not panic but the actual situation is that Trump is also very anxious The S vice president responsible for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic is even more Was so nervous praying for the new crown pneumonia epidemic to pass as soon as possible in the White House office At this time Trump made big change and began to praise China At press conference the day before yesterday an American reporter asked Trump If the new crown pneumonia outbreak in the United States worsens will the US government consider taking similar measures to China Trump immediately said that he would take some Chinese measures to control the new crown pneumonia and said that China has made great progress now We can see that Starbucks has reopened in China and Apple has fully resumed production in China China New crown pneumonia prevention and control has indeed made great progress Obviously Trump remarks came from the bottom of his heart and it is also because the role has now changed China has made significant progress in controlling the new crown pneumonia but the United States is in torrential storm More and more states An emergency was declared medical supplies in the United States were extremely scarce and an out of control epidemic of new pneumonia was almost inevitable The S stock market has plummeted continuously with drop of more than in just one week It has caught up with the big crash during the S subprime mortgage crisis This makes Trump feel like pinch Once the S stock market continues to plummet it will not only affect the S economy but also affect the economy Lampe president is re elected and once the new crown pneumonia epidemic continues Trump throne will face increasing challenges If at this time China announced that it would restrict the entry of Americans or people who have been to the United States and that it would ban the travel of Chinese to the United States it would actually impose travel ban on the United States It plummeted but China did not And everyone should know that when the new crown pneumonia epidemic broke out in Wuhan Hubei China Trump US government first announced the return of Americans from Wuhan China causing other countries to follow up making China very passive at the time Not only that the S government also announced that restricting the entry of Chinese and foreigners who have visited China into the S is actually an indirect declaration of travel ban on China which isolates other countries in the world from China and has great economic impact on China of These practices in the United States are very unkind They can be described as falling into the ground and killing people while they are ill Now China new crown pneumonia epidemic has been controlled Except for Wuhan new confirmed cases have been added in single digits But it getting worse If China retaliates against the United States at this time in addition to announcing travel ban on the United States it will also announce strategic control over medical products and ban exports to the United States Then the United States will be caught in the ocean of new crown viruses According to the US CDC officials most masks in the United States are made in China and imported from China If China bans the export of masks to the United States the United States will fall into the mask shortage and the most basic measures to prevent new crown virus Can do it Also according to the US CDC officials most of the drugs in the United States are imported and some drugs are imported from Europe However Europe also places the production base of these drugs in China so more than of the US imported drugs are Related to China The implication is that at this time as long as China announces that its drugs are as domestic as possible and banned exports the United States will fall into the hell of the new crown pneumonia epidemic However there is great love in the world The Chinese people and the Chinese government have never done so They have not insulted the United States nor have they banned the export of masks and medicines to the United States As China new crown pneumonia epidemic is gradually controlled China ability to export masks and medicines Will be greatly enhanced and the United States is one of the demand side US government officials such as Secretary of Commerce Rose US Secretary of State Pompeo and US White House Economic Adviser Navarro have publicly gloated over China new crown pneumonia epidemic saying that the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in China is good for the United States and will help companies return to the United States It also called on companies around the world to consider the risks of China supply chain Even the infamous Wall Street Journal published an infamous article China is real patient in Asia and the New York Times in the United States also published document condemning the closure of Wuhan in China as violation of human rights The American culture of falling rocks is really shameless Today Feng Shui is taking turns and the United States has become victim of the new crown pneumonia epidemic At this time China has not fallen into rocks and has not condemned the United States At this time the United States should be more mistakes for the past Apologize to China for your actions During this time voice deliberately speculated that China owes the world an apology which is very ridiculous In order to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic China has made huge sacrifices paid huge economic costs and cut off the new crown virus The route of transmission No country has made such great sacrifice and effort in this new crown pneumonia epidemic Moreover according to the research of Academician Zhong Nanshan although the new crown pneumonia epidemic broke out in China the source may not necessarily be in China Many studies have also pointed out that the origin of the new crown virus may come from other countries Many confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States Italy Iran and other countries without history of Asian contact have demonstrated this so China has no reason to apologize Now we should rightfully say that the United States owes China an apology and the world owes China gratitude Without China huge sacrifice and dedication it would not be possible to win precious time window for the world to fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic The hard to find new crown pneumonia epidemic has been blocked for long time it is really shocking crying ghosts Atlas Error correction Editor in chief Zhang Chao,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

fjccye9,SIGN IN SUBSCRIBE SHARE ARGUMENT Beijing Knows Who to Blame for the Virus America The outbreak has caused PR crisis for China BY JAMES PALMER MARCH PM S President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar meet with pharmaceutical executives to discuss the coronavirus in Washington on March MANDEL NGAN AFP GETTY IMAGES Amid national lockdown desperate patients anger at cover up an economic crisis and virus breaking beyond its own borders the Chinese government priorities were clear It was time to publish glossy book on how wonderful Beijing handling of the virus has been Battle Against Epidemic China Combating COVID in compiles numerous state media accounts on the heroic leadership of President Xi Jinping the vital role of the Communist Party and the superiority of the Chinese system in fighting the virus It has gotten rave reviews in Chinese media not least because it was published by their ultimate boss the Central Committee Publicity Department formerly known as the Propaganda Department The Chinese audience won be the only lucky readers The book will be translated into English French Spanish Russian and Arabic with more likely to follow Authorities know the virus could irreparably damage China image in the world eyes but they also see an opportunity to push their own narrative of organization success and triumph Part of that involves glossy propaganda texts combined with more sophisticated individually targeted efforts Part of it is pushing new set of conspiracy theories about the virus itself aimed at the ultimate enemy the United States The downside of the epidemic for China image is obvious There are legitimate reasons The cover up of the early extent of the outbreak by authorities more concerned with politics than pandemics gave it critical time to spread But the Chinese government is also likely to be blamed for events outside its control especially as patients and casualties pile up Authorities know the virus could irreparably damage China image in the world eyes but they also see an opportunity to push their own narrative The damage to China economy and image is also seriously worrying the leadership which has been attempting to push people back to work That damage is already visible in the United States where the virus has pushed opinions of China to record lows and made people less confident in China economic future Firms were already looking for suppliers outside of China as result of the trade war the coronavirus is giving that critical push Yet Beijing is pushing powerful counternarrative the idea that Chinese organization and authoritarianism allowed for rapid and effective response to the crisis that other countries can learn from The export of authoritarian techniques has been one of the underrated selling points of China global projects in the past few years especially in Central Asia The primary audience as always is domestic but it includes foreigners too especially in developing countries In fairness it may be that the widspread lockdown truly played critical role in containing the virus Yet it hard to know for sure because of the government led clampdown on reporting as well as the introduction of yet another set of new media and Internet controls already planned before the coronavirus At the provincial level statistics on the outbreak range from the dubious to the obviously false Disturbingly the World Health Organization already facing public criticism for its refusal to confront Chinese failures is willing participant in pushing that narrative writing comically sycophantic report on Chinese efforts based on recent managed propaganda tour of Hubei province where the virus first erupted Much of this is clumsily obvious and will have little effect on audiences with no obligation to pretend Xi speeches are rhetorical masterpieces But other parts of Chinese outreach are far smarter and more sophisticated drawing on the country huge linguistic and diplomatic resources when it comes to Africa and the Middle East in particular Take this video produced by China Radio International that been widely circulated on Telegram in Iran in which fluent Farsi speaker explains how China managed the outbreak and offers help to Iran one of the countries outside China most affected by the outbreak That the kind of engagement that can make lasting difference to ordinary people rather than fellow autocrats From early on there also been deliberate doubling down on anti S propaganda In part that was an almost instinctive reaction anti Americanism has so come to dominate the Chinese media in the last four years that it the default position for writers Even in the early weeks of the outbreak Chinese officials were blaming the United States for supposed overreaction and falsely claiming Washington was the first to impose travel bans But there also clear desire to divert anger away from officialdom and toward an external foe The fact that these stories stay up in China shows that at the very least the government is tolerating them The next stage of the propaganda push has been to deny that the virus started in China at all Quite how the virus crossed species is still unclear but there nothing to suggest it didn happen in China which saw the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan Those claims erupted on Chinese social media last week where conspiracy minded sites such as College Daily already vectors for deeply racist and Islamophobic stories winked at by the propaganda authorities are pushing the idea that the virus really originated in the United States Clips from Taiwanese TV and mistranslated captions from American reporting are used to back up the case They re helped in this by China own bad recording of flu stats which makes it appear as though the country has only had few hundred seasonal flu deaths this year when in reality to people in China die of the flu each year Claims of the deadliness of American flu appeared in January leading to officials believing that S reporters didn fear the coronavirus because they were inured to the disease The explicit claim that coronavirus started in the United States is relatively new but judging from reported conversations between Chinese abroad and their parents and grandparents at home has spread disturbingly fast Flu isn the only culprit blamed one other popular theory is that vaping deaths under President Donald Trump were cover for coronavirus fatalities READ MORE Cash Strapped Lebanon Isn Ready for the Coronavirus Taiwan Wants to Help Fight the Coronavirus WHO Won Let It It unclear how much of this is state sanctioned The United States of course has hardly been short of conspiracy theories of its own about the virus While he walked it back later Trump himself described the virus as fake news Arkansas Republican Sen Tom Cotton has also played part in spreading them But the United States doesn have thousands of government and private sector personnel dedicated to online censorship who block key search terms and take down stories and rumors unfavorable to the government with lightning speed The fact that these stories stay up in China shows that at the very least the government is tolerating them Most worryingly top Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan who has been at the front and center of the response to the outbreak recently made an enigmatic claim at press conference that the virus may not have originated in China winking at these conspiracy theories without explicitly endorsing them Even more than boasts about China effectiveness conspiracy theories are targeted at domestic audience as well as the Chinese diaspora But they re likely to be embraced elsewhere especially in countries with their own tendency to spot S plots everywhere If the coronavirus is uncontainable as many epidemiologists fear the whole world is going to be looking for someone to blame and Beijing wants to make sure that blame falls on

https www bloomberg com news articles how the novel coronavirus can maybe infect you quicktake Infection generally starts in the nose Once inside the body the coronavirus invades the epithelial cells that line and protect the respiratory tract said Taubenberger who heads the viral pathogenesis and evolution section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda Maryland If it contained in the upper airway it usually results in less severe disease But if the virus treks down the windpipe to the peripheral branches of the respiratory tree and lung tissue it can trigger more severe phase of the disease That due to the pneumonia causing damage inflicted directly by the virus plus secondary damage caused by the body immune response to the infection Your body is immediately trying to repair the damage in the lung as soon as it happening Taubenberger said Various white blood cells that consume pathogens and help heal damaged tissue act as first responders Normally if this goes well you can clear up your infection in just few days In some more severe coronavirus infections the body effort to heal itself may be too robust leading to the destruction of not just virus infected cells but healthy tissue Taubenberger said Damage to the epithelium lining the trachea and bronchi can result in the loss of protective mucus producing cells as well as the tiny hairs or cilia that sweep dirt and respiratory secretions out of the lungs You have no ability to keep stuff out of the lower respiratory tract Taubenberger said As result the lungs are vulnerable to an invasive secondary bacterial infection Potential culprits include the germs normally harbored in the nose and throat and the antibiotic resistant bacteria that thrive in hospitals

fk728u1,Here a frightening scenario from Cristina Higgins in Italy am writing to you from Bergamo Italy at the heart of the coronavirus crisis The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here am writing this post because each of you today not the government not the school district not the mayor each individual citizen has the chance today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country reality The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy can hear you now It just flu It only affects old people with preconditions There are reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it knees First it is flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU and second because of how fast and effectively it spreads There is week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country million people would go on lock down the line that struck me most was there is no more time Because to be clear this national lock down is hail mary What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down the system Italy will collapse Why Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity more than capacity They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways If the numbers do not go down the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in matter of week two weeks who will need care What will happen when there are or people who need the hospital and only few ICU places left On Monday doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room like what is done in war This will only get worse There are finite number of drs nurses medical staff and they are getting the virus They have also been working non stop non stop for days and days What happens when the drs nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients when they are not there And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients are coming in for treatment You have chance to make difference and stop the spread in your country Push for the entire office to work at home today cancel birthday parties and other gatherings stay home as much as you can If you have fever any fever stay home Push for school closures now Anything you can do to stop the spread because it is spreading in your communities there is two week incubation period and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools and do all these other things locking down Italy was beyond anyone imagination week ago Soon you will not have choice so do what you can now Please share ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

States year old male symptom progression day https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa On January year old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County Washington with day history of cough and subjective fever On checking into the clinic the patient put on mask in the waiting room After waiting approximately minutes he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by provider He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan China The patient stated that he had seen health alert from the S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and because of his symptoms and recent travel decided to see health care provider Given the patient travel history the local and state health departments were immediately notified Together with the urgent care clinician the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for nCoV on the basis of current CDC persons under investigation case definitions Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens After specimen collection the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department On January the CDC confirmed that the patient nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for nCoV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rRT PCR assay In coordination with CDC subject matter experts state and local health officials emergency medical services and hospital leadership and staff the patient was admitted to an airborne isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact droplet and airborne precautions with eye protection On admission the patient reported persistent dry cough and day history of nausea and vomiting he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain Vital signs were within normal ranges On physical examination the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable After admission the patient received supportive care including liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea On days through of hospitalization days through of illness the patient vital signs remained largely stable apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia Figure The patient continued to report nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued On the afternoon of hospital day the patient passed loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort second episode of loose stool was reported overnight sample of this stool was collected for rRT PCR testing along with additional respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal and serum The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT PCR for nCoV whereas the serum remained negative Treatment during this time was largely supportive For symptom management the patient received as needed antipyretic therapy consisting of mg of acetaminophen every hours and mg of ibuprofen every hours He also received mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately liters of normal saline over the first days of hospitalization chest radiograph taken on hospital day illness day was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities Figure However second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day illness day showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung Figure These radiographic findings coincided with change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day when the patient oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as while he was breathing ambient air On day the patient was started on supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at liters per minute Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital acquired pneumonia treatment with vancomycin mg loading dose followed by administered intravenously every hours and cefepime administered intravenously every hours was initiated On hospital day illness day fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs finding consistent with atypical pneumonia Figure and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation Given the radiographic findings the decision to administer oxygen supplementation the patient ongoing fevers the persistent positive nCoV RNA at multiple sites and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy Treatment with intravenous remdesivir novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development was initiated on the evening of day and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day and cefepime was discontinued on the following day after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus On hospital day illness day the patient clinical condition improved Supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his oxygen saturation values improved to to while he was breathing ambient air The previous bilateral lower lobe rales were no longer present His appetite improved and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and

fjfptny, gt We know that people most likely to die from corona viruses are immune compromised the only implication which would warrant this response is that notion that the flu vaccine would reduce the number of immune compromised people gt You think reducing immune compromised individuals from pool of million WON reduce deaths from tangential disease and again here implying giving the flu vaccine to individuals would boost their immunity and thus be less susceptible to coronavirus under no circumstance could you even argue that you meant something else the people who have gotten the flu already had the flu so to be included in the million subset you would have already otherwise gotten the flu and likely built some sort of immunity it would be an extremely rare case to get the same flu again after already having it thus vaccinating against the same flu doesn hold any significant increase in immunitiy the vaccine covers different variances of the flu however given that the prevalent type of flu this year was different than expected chances are the vaccine you get in march may not be really that effective of combatting whatever lingering flu there still is you re probably unlikely to get the flu again so no getting the flu vaccine in march wouldn exactly help anyone stop dying from coronavirus if they caught it and also if you re currently one of million people with the flu then nurse won likely administer the flu vaccine to you and would ask that you wait until you recover which could be another weeks so now you re looking at potential of weeks before someone currently with flu symptoms would have had adequate time to build the antibodies to just fight the flu so if at anytime you contract coronavirus over the next month you re still shit out of luck and the flu vaccine wouldn have helped you whatsoever gt Either way let take it rrreeeeaallll slow yes let me take it slow for you because while trump has his fingers in both of your ears and his balls on your chin you re having difficult time understanding why he and you are absolutely wrong here boosting immunity for the flu to combat coronavirus right now wouldn stop the transmission of coronavirus do you understand how flu vaccines work and do you even understand what the flu is the flu vaccine if administered now wouldn prevent future transmissions of coronavirus nor would it be effective in combating coronavirus in fact if we were worries about immune compromised people contracting the flu in early March all the while interested in preventing them from getting the flu the answer would be for them to stay the fuck home for now because the flu vaccine on March would take until March th before each individual immunity to the flu would start to show this means for every waking hour over the next two weeks while coronavirus spreads people with weak immune systems are still susceptible to the flu and to coronavirus m not really certain why you need this explained to you gt because you realize the point makes sense and you re embarrassed or you re really that poor of reader your initial response is unwarranted and really basically just part of the consistent handjob the magatards love giving their Trump Lard it is absolutely impossible and completely disingenuous for you to pretend that you were implying anything else other that trump was right in asking that question what fair and valid question it was and in fact he is in some ways correct that the flu vaccine would help combat this virus you re buffoon gt If you are infected with influenza and then you also contract corona virus are you MORE or LESS likely to die than if you did not carry influenza as well gt MORE or LESS Answer please yes if you have both influenza and coronavirus you will be worse off than only coronavirus however understand that being injected with the flu vaccine while having the flu may worsen your ability to fight your current flu why the fuck would you send white blood cells to attack an already dead virus and compromise your ability to fight off your current illness if you are infected with influenza will doctors administer you the flu vaccine And if not what good will the flu vaccine help you while sick from the flu What will getting the flu vaccine right now help to prevent an outbreak of more serious disease given the week period to build immunity to the flu MORE or LESS Answer please ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fhq71cc,the Hillsborough disaster isnt an average game though id assumed you meant either players on the pitch or even the firms violence after matches and ll be honest ive heard little about the yellow vest movement as the coverage here is as bad as brexit in misinformation The Hong Kong movement started due to new law the CCP had funded that didnt just allow but required extradition of anyone the CCP applied to arrest regardless of the legal basis of the criminal accusation in Hong Kong law in China there is no freedom of speech and its an arrestable offense to go against the government in any way for example read up about Li Wenliang the whistleblower for coronavirus which would mean that the population of foreign country hong kong would be subject to the laws of china That is internationally recognised legal grounds that the UK government had to cave in to during the troubles in Ireland Furthermore the UK and China agreed in the that Hong Kong would remain independant for scheduled time and the laws being backed by the CCP in Hong Kong would have illegally subverted this international agreement would appreciate more information on Uighur history in China but my reason for believing the story in the first place was that China dont provide any details on the terror attacks and even then you are arguing that whole people should be locked up in concentration camps because small minority are extremists should the UK have arrested everyone in ireland during the troubles there was much higher population of extremists in Ireland after Bloody Sunday than any muslim population ive heard of Is the UK government in the right for their actions during Bloody Sunday just because you believe being outnumbered by peaceful protest is reason enough to use live weapons and that everyone does it so why should we argue against it In hong kong they brought in military grade APCs and used live weapons not just rubber bullets and tear gas The problem with China as opposed to Russia and USA is theyre at an orwellian level of control with government policy only comparable to either Stalin or Hitler The USA is heading towards Mussolini level of facism and Russia is an olligarchy created from the various city mafias that sprung up after the soviet union To the media point id disagree mainly on our opinion of what the demand is people want to see action and its only since dickheads like mcconnell came into power that the belief all media rather than just some media is propaganda as it plays into the hands of politicians instead of action and accountability of old media digital media has allowed them to spin things before anyone can be made accountable for their actions Dismissing something as fake without providing any evidence wasnt thing before con man swayed the closed minded into letting him steal the presidency as such believe using fake news turns your own bias into propaganda by closing your own mind to new information after your edit this is where my misinterpretation happened couldnt figure out if you were arguing that this mindset is justified or that the chinese people agree with the government On governmental level you are correct as they are no different to other politicians but rememeber the people have no ability to fight back see your argument about the uighurs and justification surrounding the hong kong situation which imo negates your plato argument as he was never saying our government should have right to ignore the will of the people but rather that it was an issue that we dont have the ability to control as power will always attract corrupt people The difference is now we can control it better the orwellian nature of the CCP shows that everyone can be controlled and the only reason its not been used on the corrupt is theyre still in power Brexit was suggested due to corruption in taxes leading to level of transparency the powerful dont want the misinformation throughout the brexit process shows that the fake news mentality is corruptive in and of itself and the results of brexit both the votes and the deals is evidence to your point but your argument seems to be that we should give up and let ourselves be tricked as thats how its always happened instead of grouping together and demanding better The points of Hong Kong protesters were reasonable and simply demanded for their basic rights already guaranteed in the China UK agreement be respected but youre arguing that the protesters were the ones in the wrong even though the CCP only listened when countries started threatening sanctions TLDR both sides push propaganda but it is far from equal in its extremes,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

flaufsp,I no fan of China authoritarianism but this is BS The Hubei provincial government bungled the initial response They suppressed information early on arrested the doctor and downplayed the problem They absolutely deserve some blame for this pandemic We might even be able to say that the provincial government failures are due to structural issues in China with the central government being too strong and controlling BUT Once Xi and the central government realized there was problem about mid January they took strong decisive and effective action They followed science they tested they were transparent in the numbers They coordinated cohesive response across the country They mobilized government military and the private sector They made decisions with much less information known about the virus than we have today e they did not know the they did not know the mortality rates they did not have full understanding of the symptoms and behaviour of the virus Most of those decisions turned out to be the right call And they implemented social distancing quickly and effectively When we compare the Chinese response to the western response we see competence science gutsy decision making and ultimately we see positive outcomes m frankly embarassed by Trump leadership and decision making The safest place in the world right now to be is China America can even get basic testing working It like fucking third world country Slow bureaucratic insanely expensive for everything related to health care Uncoordinated responses Politicians who claim you can be cured from the coronavirus by breathing in hot air from hair dryer Ultimately we are going to see massive numbers of infections and deaths The contrast between the two responses shows good leadership vs incompetent leadership The Chinese economy hit some road bumps but it is not devastated We ll see what happens to the American economy but it not going to be good Now in the aftermath China is the first to recover and is in good position to help out others They are doing some carefully crafted PR which we might be able to say isn entirely selfless they are perhaps trying to take advantage of their situation to maximize their economic benefit think most countries would do the same hope American manufacturing and business can rise to the occasion and meet at least domestic needs People like Elon Musk give me glimmers of hope But with the dysfunction in our politics divided nation and incompetent president we will probably screw this up too And China will make boat loads of cash helping the western world crawl out of the pandemic and rebuilding Maybe it not so different from the US helping Europe rebuild after WW But m sure we ll find way to look down on China and tell them our way is better ,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

fk6unnn,Point system for social distancing made this because social distancing is difficult behavior to adopt for long periods of time almost like trying to lose weight You will eventually have cravings or legitimate reasons to seek out people Some of these risks may be unavoidable But just as counting calories is tried and true method for weight loss this point system for risk is supposed to encourage social distancing Your total health risk is proportional to the below exposures the incidence of Covid in your community and your underlying susceptibility based on age health condition Risk of each exposure low very high Cruises Enclosed space for airborne transmission Additional fomite to face transmission with large reservoirs of disease in the crew who live in close quarters and prepare food Hundreds of people within degrees of separation Cumulative exposure time is very high since ppl are in contact over span of days to weeks Working in hospital Gathering place for Covid people Environmental services food amp medical staff can cross pollinate the disease Use of PPE is mitigating factor but imperfect especially with short supplies and worker fatigue or lack of engagement Also whereas all the other places would close down if there is Covid case detected this is the one situation where the facility continues to operate with cases mixed in Airplane travel Enclosed space for airborne transmission Interaction between flight crew amp passengers means degree separation number is also in hundreds Large mixing of ppl from various cities amp countries Cumulative exposure time is not as high few hours in the airport or on the plane Confirmed Covid airport workers in the news testify to this being real risk Pre schools Enclosed space for airborne amp fomite transmission Potential for large reservoirs of asymptomatic carriers poor hygiene with shared toys fomites Compared to cruise however the pre school size is not as big Cumulative exposure time is high school hours days week Schools Compared to pre schools better hygiene but larger student population Cumulative exposure time is high Going to clinic for medical visit Has all of the above risks as healthcare facility work but mitigating factor is that you have less exposure time You have to weigh the importance of the medical visit against the risks Working or staying in SNF More chronically ill patients with nursing needs Shared food janitorial staff but size is smaller than hospital Worker fatigue is usually higher than hospital as more NA needs and could lead to less PPE use Even prior to Covid SNFs have been known for nosocomial infections such as ESBL dif and HCAP Concert Sporting event Church High risk in that multiple people gathering in one room within arm length however the cumulative exposure time is short compared to the all day activities Office work Highly dependent on the type of work which would affect office layout frequency of meetings amp whether ppl are sharing keyboards or cubicles Provided that you have your own desk stay at arms length have some people tele commuting then the social distancing of an office may be quite good Bathrooms kitchenettes still high risk Going to restaurant Depends on the restaurant Restaurant workers could be reservoir of disease and number of degree separation interactions could be hundreds in day Depends highly on food prep utensil washing practices hot food vs cold food and the customer volume of the restaurant fast casual vs niche sit down place We don know exact risk numbers yet but speculate that oral ingestion of virus with some residue in the oropharynx may be less risky than droplet to face contact Public transportation Smaller enclosed spread would be more droplet spread Sort of socially unacceptable to be wiping things down Most people not wearing masks in my part of the world Having housekeeper or nanny May be necessary as more people have WFH amp kids out of school The hired worker may be in contact with multiple households in their line of Major mitigating factor for cleaning is that they are using cleaning products Major factor for nanny is that it is still better than preschool Having few friends over Risk is reduced due to less people but it depends on your friends included this as less harmful alternative for those with serious cravings for restaurants events Going to the supermarket Risk of fomite or airborne transmission but this is quick trip and you are at arms length away from people for the most part Hike parks playground Open air Potential for fomite to face transmission but could be mitigated by hand hygiene and low exposure time Staying at home with Covid person Very high exposure time Fomite airborne transmission risk very high Not much mitigation can be done hard to keep PPE on within your own home Plates bedding clothing are all high fomite risks amp B Some people who have fatalistic view for Covid why should go through all this if m going to get it eventually but slow spread will decrease saturation of the hospital system Other people are not worried because the incidence is still low in their community at this time but this could change rapidly and you don want to be lulled by false security do think that making sacrifices for social distancing does make huge difference that will both benefit us individually and the community as whole Just like weight loss new habit starts today ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

dlumxbl,I guess should tell you the story of how got expelled from my favorite High School month before graduation This happened in all because gave one mysterious DVD from my attic to random kid in Grade Seven You see had bunch of war movies and historical documentaries up in the crawlspace above my bedroom think lot of them came from my grandfather who died when was very young He loved to watch war movies and he also liked historical documentaries was going strong was popular had good grades everybody respected me Then it all fell apart after gave one DVD to boy at my school kid about twelve believe will refer to him as Toshio his last name was Japanese but his first name was something along the lines of Sammy He was very into reading about history mostly European history and Ancient East Asian history He was very obsessed with Japan and kept rambling about what great place it was even though don believe he ever actually stayed much longer than month with his grandparents back in Tokyo An annoying kid but sort of endearing too We both live in Canada knew he also liked to watch history documentaries too and also happened to know when his birthday was So on Friday May grabbed the documentary had not bothered to check it out myself but suspected it was about the Japanese war effort from my dusty attic and went to school wanted to make this little brat aware of Japan darker side On that Friday morning saw Toshio in the hallway skinny almost skeletal looking kid with big grin on his face and surprising physical strength considering he was not much more than hundred pounds He saw me and came bouncing along probably Autism or something Toshio happy birthday heard you like watching history films so found some old history documentaries said and grabbing the dusty DVDs pushed them into his hands The na ve little boy apparently thought was his friend not once did he seem to think that was tricking him waited until he was out of sight and earshot then did very evil laugh didn really know him that well but we chatted every now and then and were in many of the same clubs It was not until Monday morning when was riding the train back to school that decided just maybe this was not the smartest idea wondered if it was too late to call him and tell him not to watch it then realized that whole two days had passed and more likely than not he had already watched them was not too worried figured it would make him less annoying but did not think that he was going to be scarred for life or anything like that quickly realized that Toshio was not at school probably flu or something like that noticed my classmates glancing angrily at me and my teacher Mrs Clinley giving me the evil eye every now and then had feeling that something terrible had happened to Toshio and these people all knew was not confronted about my deeds until lunchtime but overheard the people in the back whispering about me don remember exactly what they were saying but it seemed they were both impressed and disgusted wonder if my name did this on purpose It seems almost planned one girl said to her neighbor He came off as bit of jerk feel bad for the kid boy said Good for people to learn about the darker parts of history but maybe that kid was little too young to be watching film about the Nanjing Massacre second boy said Poor Toshio he didn know what he was getting into when he took those DVDs from that guy Who traumatizes kid like that another girl whispered It is good for people to learn about history but think the kid might have been little too young to learn about the Nanjing Massacre At least wait until he is old enough that he has the emotional capabilities to handle the knowledge of such an exceptionally horrible event the girl from before said knew by this point that had fucked up The loud footsteps that interrupted their conversation were ominous slowly turned around and saw my history teacher fat lady who dyed her hair green for some weird reason glaring down at me She was very obviously upset Office right now she commanded and walked away without second glance There were some loud Oooooohs and somebody said He is going to die now He is deader than dinosaur knew that was doomed but held on to hope that maybe they would think it was misunderstanding didn want my reputation ruined after all hesitated as approached the office door wondering if maybe should just run away Obviously didn I took deep breath and opened the door to see that obese bitch and the principal Mr Black muscular black man who was very stern but calm What were you thinking young man What were you even thinking There is reason we don teach the dark stuff to children that young she screeched had no response She sighed shaking her head Why would you even think this was good idea Just why It would had been one thing if you gave documentary on the Black Death to him but out of all the documentaries you chose to give him you gave him one on the Nanjing Massacre she asked very incredulous It was an accident thought the DVD was something else thought it was DVD on the Cold War protested but neither she or Mr Black seemed convinced There will be consequences young man the fat hag said to me want to ask you something Mr Black said suddenly You are white male and he is Asian did you see his Japanese surname and decide that you should enlighten him on the darker history of Japan First of all am sure he already had some knowledge about Japan imperialistic past and second of all that film was very age inappropriate it has graphic footage from the battlefield in China very gruesome and really not fit to be shown to child the principal had said to me was getting angry at this point That kid has watched films about the Holocaust and such why is he unable to stomach documentary showing footage from the Nanjing Massacre What crybaby wimp had blurted out much to Mrs Clinley shock That film is not appropriate for him Did you even know what it contained she asked The Japanese cannot hide from the truth of their terrible deeds forever said defiantly No but child does not need to have his innocence shattered like this The poor kid has not even developed the emotional capacities to handle such knowledge she screamed What are you talking about He watches films about the Holocaust retorted The principal sighed shaking his head as he stood up Look those are age appropriate films meant to be viewed by young children What you showed him was something very much not intended for twelve year old boy to be viewing It contained very graphic footage footage and images very disturbing ones Furthermore you realize that Toshio is actually of Japanese and Chinese descent right Yeah you gave him schizophrenia am afraid He seems to have developed split personality according to the doctors the principle said At first thought they were joking What weak little bitch blurted out while laughing Big mistake Aftermath So was expelled from this school which had gone to since Kindergarten and had to retake Grade had to write letter of apology to that boy and his family my parents had to pay for his therapy did not get to go to the university of my choice All my friends hate me and have ghosted me from this point on My life is probably ruined Fuck these special snowflakes they are way too oversensitive and it is destroying Western civilization TL DR being

ffm7kup,January With at least cases confirmed worldwide concerns over the latest coronavirus outbreak continue to escalate Researchers from China report on the epidemiological and radiological characteristics of the novel virus and clinical outcomes of the first set of infected individuals in two studies that were published January in Lancet Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals Though most coronavirus infections are mild the new betacoronavirus nCoV appears to cause similar symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS Both SARS and MERS are known to trigger respiratory tract diseases and their outbreaks were collectively responsible for over thousand deaths in the past two decades In new study researchers from several institutions in China examined the first patients confirmed to be infected with nCoV and admitted to Jin Yin tan Hospital in Wuhan between December and January They combined patient data from clinical records laboratory tests and CT exams in their assessment The patients had median age of had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan and more than two thirds were otherwise healthy individuals Upon evaluating the data the group found that the infected patients presented with broad range of symptoms including fever cough fatigue sputum production and diarrhea More than half of the patients developed shortness of breath roughly eight days from the onset of illness Despite sharing some similar symptoms to SARS g fever dry cough shortness of breath there are some important differences such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms g rhinorrhoea sneezing sore throat and intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea senior author Dr Bin Cao from Capital Medical University said in statement The imaging findings also revealed that all of the patients had abnormalities evident on their chest CT scans indicative of pneumonia with of the cases showing bilateral involvement Typical findings for patients transferred to the intensive care unit ICU were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation For non ICU patients the scans commonly showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation Furthermore nearly of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome Six patients in the cohort died shortly after hospital admission five had acute cardiac injury and four required ventilation To prevent the nCoV outbreak from becoming pandemic the situation needs to be carefully monitored and the virus must be deeply studied the authors noted Reliable pathogen tests and differential diagnosis based on clinical description and imaging are crucial for clinicians during their first contact with suspected patients Person to person An associated study also published in the Lancet led by Dr Kwok Yung Yuen from the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital investigated the way the coronavirus disseminated among family that visited Wuhan from December to January Of six family members who traveled to Wuhan five were confirmed to have nCoV None of them had visited the Huanan seafood market and separate family member who did not travel to the region was also infected suggesting that the coronavirus is capable of spreading from person to person The most likely explanation for the family infections is that one individual acquired the coronavirus while visiting relative at the Wuhan hospital then later transmitted it to the rest of her family the authors said One of the infected individuals had no clinical symptoms of disease indicating that asymptomatic infected individuals may continue to spread the virus unwittingly Because asymptomatic infection appears possible controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible educating the public on both food and personal hygiene and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control Yuen said in statement All of the infected family members except for the asymptomatic individual presented with combination of fever upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms and diarrhea three to six days after exposure Chest CT scans showed ground glass opacities in all of the patients with more extensive radiological changes seen on the scans of the older patients more than years old The researchers have made publicly available the complete nCoV genome which they identified from two clinical samples Gaps in understanding nCoV has also proved capable of remaining infectious in individuals through extended travel with reports of the coronavirus having emerged in at least seven other countries The S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has confirmed two cases of coronavirus in the country among at least patients currently under investigation In linked commentary representatives from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Chinese CDC Oxford University clinical research unit in Vietnam and University of Virginia School of Medicine underscored the importance of widespread awareness and improving current understanding of the coronavirus To improve detection efficiency front line clinics apart from local centers for disease control and prevention should be armed with validated point of care diagnostic kits Education campaigns should be launched to promote precautions for travelers including frequent hand washing cough etiquette and use of personal protection equipment g masks when visiting public places they wrote As there are no existing coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans pressing need remains to develop best supportive care and vaccine they concluded Every effort

fl67bkd,Look at the following timeline and just imagine What if there was no impeachment What if the S attention wasn completely diverted at critical time Could the S have passed laws that were made impossible by impeachment to increase production of masks and other needed supplies helping the whole world weather the storm much better What if Democrats supported President Trumps travel ban against China instead of attacking it What if most of the media supported such travel ban instead of condemning it as racist What if such support instead of petty political attacks meant that travel bans were spreading quickly all over the world How many lives could have been saved The US has enormous capacity financially and through setting an example Early action instead of Impeachment could have benefited the whole world million lives all over the world is not stretch Save this post and look back when we know the final death figures It seems that by diverting attention to impeachment at an absolutely critical time the Democrats and the media contributed to an enormous amount of death and destruction world wide The true costs of which may never be known TIMELINE Late November coronavirus appears and starts spreading in China undetected Early December coronavirus continues to spread silently December According to an official document on the website of United States House of Representatives the House was fully briefed on the largest pandemic exercise ever to take place in the S The exercise found that additional funding would likely be required And that S lacks sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity and or raw materials for needles syringes masks and personal protective equipment The report notes that In pandemic global manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient to meet demand resulting in an inability to import adequate quantities The report is fully ignored and impeachment is pushed instead https web archive org web https docs house gov meetings IF IF HHRG IF Wstate KadlecMDMTMHMSR pdf December Speaker Pelosi authorizes the Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment December new viral outbreak was first detected in the city of Wuhan China December The Judiciary Committee votes along party lines to pass articles of impeachment December The formal impeachment vote by the full House of Representatives passes by Democrat votes to approve articles of impeachment December coronavirus becomes detected then identified in Lab in China Determined to be most closely related to bat SARS like coronavirus This is not widely

sign for delivery January articles are presented formally to the Senate Senate is forced to set aside all other matters under the constitution Senate is fully disabled for the duration and can deal with no other matters as they are considered less important than impeachment January China places million people under quarantine and locks Wuhan off completely The largest such measure in human history up to that point Every politician and media figure is meanwhile fixated on opening arguments of the impeachment managers January Impeachment arguments continue with often live coverage for several hours per day It taking up close to of all time and attention for politicians and media Meanwhile China expands travel restrictions and other measures to hundreds of millions of citizens Cars are banned in Wuhan for private use and anyone with fever is taken to forced isolation January Senate holds vote on allowing further witnesses Mitt Romney and all Democrats vote for witnesses without limitations the impeachment trial could still be going on if this vote went through disabling the Senate and any ability of the S to react with Legislation for months on end January President Trump imposes full travel ban to and from China This not only includes citizens of China but of other countries as well who traveled there This is one of the strongest and earliest measures taken The media and Democrats immediately condemn the ban many calling it racist Joe Biden calls the ban hysterical xenophobia the same day it was announced February The Senate acquits President Trump finally ending the impeachment hoax which dominated S attention at the most critical time when the outbreak was still in its early stages February Mitt Romney votes for one of the articles ensuring that media attention is on his vote and his speech outlining reasons for it This means the media is focused on impeachment for at least another week instead of the coronavirus Impeachment discussions continues

fkg3de8,This is worth reading Utilize the truth herein to stay focused on manifesting greater reality We are not alone seek the tools given to us via our evolutionary process Hi everyone Here is great message from Dr Bruce Lipton Ph in microbiology and the father of epigenetics Lee Carroll March Dear Family of Love and Seekers Everywhere Coronavirus Do Not Fear the Bogeyman The world is currently gripped in fear of the scary coronavirus Let first get one fact clear If you have ever had cold or flu in your life odds are that it was the result of coronavirus infection Yes coronaviruses cause colds But we are being programmed with the belief that this particular cold virus is deadly This fear has shut down concerts conferences and major public events all over the world The fear has led to quarantines and closing down of international travel It has even led to major scarcity of toilet paper in Australia were concerned citizens emptied the shelves of this commodity in anticipation that they will be walled up in their homes with this infection First how deadly is this version of the virus Yes there have been corona related deaths reported with initial statistics suggesting that of the infected population dies Wow That number is almost more deaths than are attributed to any conventional flu the world experiences Note Percentage of flu deaths is based on world population However each country has its own statistics for example in the US the flu death rate is about while less developed countries may have up to mortality Additionally the percentage of covid mortality is inflated since many infected patients with mild symptoms are not reported see article attached below What is misleading is the fear that everyone who carries this virus may die from their cold This is simply untrue The health of almost all the covid victims was already compromised before they were infected For example the following information was provided by the news in regard to the patients that died of the virus in the state of Washington last week added the bold print Washington State Six people have died in Washington and health officials have identified cases Four of the cases in King County were linked to the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland More than residents and staff at the facility are being tested The deaths announced Monday according to health officials included male in his who lived at LifeCare He had underlying health conditions and died Sunday female resident of LifeCare in her She also had underlying health conditions and died Sunday woman in her who was already reported as in critical condition at EvergreenHealth died Sunday Snohomish County resident at EvergreenHealth also died but details of that patient have not been given Two previously reported deaths included man in his who had underlying health conditions and had been resident of LifeCare He died at EvergreenHealth on Feb The other was man in his with underlying health conditions He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus He died at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland As emphasized in this report the health of all those that died with the coronavirus was already compromised Healthy people get cold and flu symptoms while those already sick and near death door may experience the Grim Reaper when infected by the virus True sick people are more vulnerable to the virus healthy people really have nothing to fear As presented in The Biology of Belief stress is responsible for up to of illness including heart disease cancer and diabetes When an individual is in stress the release of stress hormones g cortisol shuts down the immune system to conserve the body energy for running away from the perceived stressor that proverbial saber toothed tiger Stress hormones are so effective at compromising the immune system that physicians therapeutically provide recipients of organ transplants with stress hormones to prevent their immune system from rejecting the foreign implant The conclusion is clear The fear of the coronavirus is more deadly than the virus itself The media perhaps in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry is compromising people health using the fear card This is the result of negative thinking the nocebo effect which is the complete opposite of the placebo effect manifest through positive thinking If you make efforts to stay healthy with good nutrition exercise taking vitamins and supplements and more importantly avoiding stress g the fear of the virus even if you do get infected with the virus you will likely only end up with cold and or slight fever If you are someone with compromised immune system it is supportive to surround yourself with loving family and friends nature and positive thoughts as well as any other nutrition and vitamins that you may already be taking for your health and wellbeing Following your intuition about what is best for you is key The point here is that no matter who you are and what your state of health you will only benefit from steering clear of the fear and supporting yourself in whatever way feels best to you Please remember the truth of quantum physics the most valid of all sciences on the planet Consciousness is creating your life experiences Are you being conscious of disease or of health Wishing you all Health Happiness and Harmdirector general and Light Bruce From the The Guardian newspaper in England March What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus It is probably about or bit less than Much higher figures have been flying the bout but the chief medical officer Chris Whitty is one of those who believes it will prove to be or lower The World Health Organization director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus talked of but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted which would bring the mortality rate significantly down Deaths are highest in the elderly with very low rates among younger people although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to lot of

fldvhxr,https www globaltimes cn content shtml Quarantine exemption for arrivals via HK to mainland sparks fear of second outbreak wave By Leng Shumei Hu Yuwei and Sun Haoran Source Global Times Published Last Updated Experts and netizens called for strict quarantine policies on arrivals from Hong Kong to the mainland to prevent the possible second wave of an outbreak as the region is apparently exempted from the mainland strict screening system amid mounting risk of imported cases Hong Kong reported news cases on Friday of which the majority are returnees from Europe the new pandemic epicenter the US Canada and Thailand the Xinhua News Agency reported Saturday The city is facing extreme risk of imported cases Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Friday after taking stock of the screening efforts at the city local airport All international arrivals to Hong Kong must quarantine for days at homes or designated centers starting Friday as mandated by the SAR government Lam estimated that more overseas Hongkongers are likely to return to the city in the following one or two weeks As an international hub as well as an important gateway to the Chinese mainland the risk Hong Kong faces is also passed on to the mainland However although most places in the mainland announced strict measures to prevent and control imported cases arrivals from are seemingly receiving special treatment which some analysts warned would probably create loopholes on the mainland anti pandemic mechanism and trigger second wave of the outbreak Hong Kong resident surnamed Liu working in Beijing told the Global Times he was directly allowed entry into Guangzhou capital of South China Guangdong Province when returning from Malaysia on Wednesday The Guangzhou customs simply screened his temperature before issuing him health quarantine approval which stated the passenger has passed quarantine procedure according to Liu Guangzhou authority requires arrivals from pandemic affected countries and regions including Malaysia to undergo day quarantine starting Friday The province updated its prevention policies Saturday making it mandatory for arrivals through Hong Kong to undergo quarantine for days however it did not give clear explanation on how they would deal with those heading to other provinces and regions in the mainland Analysts said the move indicates Guangdong is seeking way to divert pressure as too many international arrivals come to the province every day requiring quarantine but by allowing travelers like Liu to proceed to other regions loopholes are left unchecked Hong Kong has different testing standards to that of the mainland People entering the mainland from the city should not be exempted from concentrated quarantine amid the dangerous trend of the recent surge in cases in Hong Kong they noted While Hong Kong witnessed the biggest single day jump in new cases the Chinese mainland has reported zero domestic cases of infection for the third consecutive media reported Saturday All the new cases reported recently in the mainland are imported cases and the number of such cases on Friday reached Most of these travelers confirmed with COVID entered the mainland via Beijing Shanghai and Guangdong The aforementioned traveler Liu flew to Beijing on Thursday from Guangzhou thus bypassing the screening procedure in the Chinese capital for international arrivals He was refused admission to Beijing hotel for self quarantine as he did not have mainland ID number He finally found designated hotel for quarantine after accessing list of such hotels that he obtained from his residential community in Beijing Similar instances have been reported in Shanghai and Shenzhen another important gateway to the mainland in Guangdong adjoining Hong Kong According to media reports Shenzhen authorities issue direct pass to arrivals from Hong Kong if they claim they have not been abroad in the past days It is time to bring Hong Kong under the ambit of the mandatory quarantine policies some analysts urged Local governments which are authorized to frame specific quarantine policies should put aside the consideration from political perspective and act at the earliest so the Chinese mainland hard earned achievements in the anti pandemic fight thrive analysts said It has come to time that we have to do this Any possible loophole must be plugged and this is the base for us to sustain cross border traffic they noted Some experts also suggest strengthened cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong to ward off imported infection risks The Hong Kong regional government itself may not be able to handle the prevention work associated with the huge influx of international visitors and returnees that is looming large It needs to cooperate with Shenzhen to jointly manage the situation they said After Hong Kong mandatory day quarantine policy for international arrivals came into force on Friday some mainland residents who planned to return home via Hong Kong have sought help on social media platforms as they are afraid they would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong upon arrival According to media reports Hong Kong authorities would probably deny boarding to passengers who try to reach the mainland via Hong Kong unless they are taking connecting flight which means they would not leave the transit zone after disembarking at the Hong Kong airport Similarly several Shenzhen locals who planned to return home via the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint could not leave the airport and pass the checkpoint as predicted They had to fly to Shanghai or Beijing and transfer for Shenzhen which further raises the risk of infection Despite concerns and risks some epidemiologists are confident of the anti pandemic battle due to sufficient internal cooperation between the mainland cities and the Hong Kong SAR Hong Kong and the mainland have maintained an efficient exchange of data and information on the epidemic taken unified actions and established joint prevention and control mechanisms which have been maintained well in previous outbreaks including SARS in Yang Gonghuan former vice director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the Global Times Saturday If the situation in Hong Kong worsens the mainland will take emergency measures as soon as possible

need to know As of on Jan there are officially confirmed cases in China across provinces suspected cases reported in provinces deaths and are severe cases deaths occurred in Hubei province where Wuhan is located with death in Hubei province and in Heilongjiang province deaths range from years old deaths are of the elderly above years of age Most have pre existing conditions that seem to predispose to more severe disease presentation People who are already sick prior to infection may be more at risk due to decreased immunity Some of these people had hypertension diabetes and Parkinson Death was typically the result of severe respiratory failure but includes others like multi organ failure Information on the remaining deaths is currently unknown There are people who have recovered will update

are very likely overwhelmed in Wuhan Physicians may be working non stop despite the period of celebration for the Lunar New Year There speculation that China may be voluntarily hiding how much people are infected deceased It possible but in my opinion not likely Hospitals are likely overrun with people presenting even the mildest flu like symptoms There is delay due to the spectrum of illness and degree of asymptomatic spread among other factors China does deserve some credit If you compare the timeline with the SARS outbreak we are doing way better availability of data transparency measures of control research etc remember laying in bed and jumping up when was notified that the preliminary complete genome was available was excited As expected there are new strains as the virus infects new populations As it jumps from host to host it potentially arms itself for more efficient transmission There are genomes publicly available Please note that we are still in the very early stages with preliminary data only giving us rough idea of what to expect We do not know the natural host and whether there are intermediate amplification hosts With SARS it was bats gt palmed civet gt humans Preliminary data suggests that the zoonotic event animal to human event happened recently There is very low diversity between sequenced genomes Preliminary data compared to SARS shows mutations in the surface proteins needed to bind human cells and relatively conserved protease The virus makes big protein that gets chopped up with this protease in order to replicate also want to stress that it is quite easy to sit behind screen and throw blame around Granted there are certain contributing factors leading to this outbreak but in my opinion there is time to address those At the moment there needs to be focus on containment and research If you re outside of China and worried about it consider how it would feel to be in China There are good people doing good work Be critical of media

fkh5n6e,So based on everything ve read the government approach seems to be what am going to call the Lord Farquaad strategy some of you may die but that is sacrifice that am willing to make It presupposes that high proportion of us will inevitably contract the virus estimates range from to that many will die but that many of us will then develop an immunity that will prevent us infecting others in the future Incidentally this strategy wasn even supported by majority of the government own scientific advisers https twitter com peterjukes status It also leaves us completely defenceless if the two currently unproven assumptions that people who have been infected and survived are now completely immune from contracting it again infecting others and that the virus won mutate at all there are many different strains of the flu for example The other problem with this strategy however is that it has not been coupled with comprehensive information advice on protecting more vulnerable people through strategies like social distancing g the elderly and those with underlying health conditions indeed it almost seems that lack of information is deliberate choice to ensure that the virus does spread more rapidly and achieve the theorised herd immunity situation quicker To ask people to support strategy that accepts an acceptable level of deaths without even the pretence of looking like they are trying to minimise unnecessary deaths of the most elderly vulnerable naturally gives many of us no confidence at all that this government cares about protecting its own citizens This is why we are seeing people taking matters into their own hands with events being cancelled the Premier League being suspended etc and why the government are now scrambling to adapt to people ignoring them and doing what they like More widely this situation demonstrates that having high level of social solidarity high levels of trust in our own government and the experts that it chooses to listen to and willingness to believe their narratives would be extremely beneficial in public health crisis like this which requires people to voluntarily change their own behaviour And even taking my own biases out as much as can the life and career of Boris Johnson up to now does not suggest that the current prime minister is somebody that has ever taken an active interest in putting other people lives first or someone with any interest in telling hard truths when necessary indeed he been literally sacked from jobs in two different professions journalism and politics for continuously lying and failing to take responsibility for anything So is it any wonder that we don trust him now to effectively and compassionately lead high risk strategy with very little scientific basis So far as can see this approach reeks of the decisions of people who feel nothing when people they don know die and whom are willing to accept high number of deaths just to see if their strategy works it is out of step with how the entire rest of the world is approaching things it is based on very fragile scientific hypotheses without solid evidence base and it is taking huge gamble with our lives without giving us any solid justification as to why it has been chosen as the way to combat coronavirus ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fl7tb0t,Part III It like this thing blew up in my face said Parker Simms student from the University of Kentucky who came to Fort Lauderdale last Saturday with friends and big plans It blew up during my spring break week In the debate between economics and epidemiology local officials generally took the side of money and revelry Late in the week though many joined the shutdown trend By Thursday the beach in Fort Lauderdale was eerily empty save for stacked chairs and lifeguard towers cluster of college students with roller bags and floppy straw hats walked toward waiting SUV headed to the airport Not all beachgoers were young people retired doctor and self described metal detectorist named Larry Leguire from Columbus Ohio had been in Florida since December On Thursday on Clearwater Beach he found four rings two of which he believed were gold plus handful of coins aluminum cans pull tabs and bottle caps It was crazy out here yesterday Mr Leguire said You saw it right Today is lot less think it the coronavirus and the news about all the kids congregating Mr Leguire said he and his wife keep distance from others and wear gloves and masks in grocery stores He was not happy to learn that the beach was closing Friday night The beach is my life and without the beach it like why be in Florida he said might as well go back home and sequester myself in my house in Columbus Ohio Formal gatherings like funerals and weddings were canceled or reconsidered At backyard wedding near Anaheim Calif on Saturday night DJ named Amanda was so nervous about performing that she did not shake the groom hand or let anyone touch her microphone At that point the advice was that gatherings of or less were OK she said few days later But wouldn do it now In Brooklyn Hasidic Jews defied isolation orders and held weddings others continued gathering for prayer In Fort Lauderdale Fla wedding planned for late March was expedited and shrunk Charlotte Jay and Blake Parker both called their rabbi invited dozen close relatives to Mr Parker parents condo and rushed to get ready Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer greeted guests on an outdoor terrace Mr Parker mother played the Beatles All You

or kiss My dad elbow bumps Blake Then he elbow bumps me Others tried to treat these as normal times though contrasts were easy to spot California Santa Monica Pier was closed its amusement park quiet and still but surfers continued riding waves below it On Wednesday afternoon in Los Angeles Fairfax District groups of runners dripped sweat on the near empty streets zooming past day laborers humming corridos At the Erewhon market mile away both the middle aged and millennials sipped to go coffees and munched plates of roasted organic carrots and beets at clusters of outdoor tables At nearby Pan Pacific Park basketball players filled court and CrossFitters heaved kettlebells on the grass It seemed more leisurely Sunday than mounting global emergency Among the unexpected places to see virus induced surge in visitors were some national parks Big Bend National Park in Texas had lines of cars week ago and was packed earlier this week even as isolation orders rolled across the country Most national parks waived entrance fees but closed visitors centers Yosemite National Park was among those to shut down lodging and on Friday afternoon closed entirely On Saturday people in the Bay Area ignored stay in place orders and crowded outdoor places like the Marin Headlands and Point Reyes National Seashore which reported unprecedented visitation Any type of middle of nowhere congregation created new kind of worry rural areas with limited medical facilities being overrun with tourists just as the pandemic strikes in full That concern shut down Colorado ski resorts Islands in Maine and North Carolina barred visitors In Moab Utah an area known for rock climbing and mountain biking near Arches National Park health officials shut down hotels to everyone but local residents or those traveling for work after executives from the bed Moab Regional Hospital implored the state to help That was the concern in Bishop The Bishop Area Climbers Coalition ultimately asked climbing friends to not travel to Bishop at this time We re worried about what will happen if and when Bishop turns into its own little cluster of the coronavirus Deikis the coalition vice president said on Wednesday By Friday after shops had closed and Gov Gavin Newsom of California gave shelter in place order the town was relatively quiet again There was no outrunning the effects of the coronavirus even at the edge of the continent In Key West Fla red black and yellow buoy marking the southernmost point in the continental United States is hot spot for tourists line forms every day all day for the photo op

fjgg3oq,I think hopefully understand what you are trying to say and while it is true your way of writing is very confusing it quite shame that many are understandably downvoting you for post well worth discussing and one personally enjoy doing to everything that is seeing coronavirus under the lens of philosophy From what can see from your post you have brought up the duality of many problems in human society when placed in to the real world of which you say is deserving of us will try converting it into philosophical discussion First how the pride of the objectively more educated and more morally good make them look down at the objectively lesser educated and less good in crisis like this to the point where the educated good find the act of looking down at others form of entertainment Just like in this and many other subreddits not to mention human social groups in general causing the sensationalization of information about the crisis for the educated giving them caricatured what some might call de humanizing view of the fools and villians as they win their darwin awards and get hit by karma Morally speaking could these acts of looking down be and is considered by some wrong Same goes for those who are objectively less intelligent and less good If there is such as objectively thing in this crisis These people are damned to be fools and damned to be evil Their foolishness and evilness of these people exist with more bad group of parts in them stupidity greed uncaring to differentiate from the rest that have less bad parts by fact of being and have more good parts Intelligence generosity kind by fact of being the same way dogs are cute to some by fact of being and spiders are scary to some by fact of being Do they deserve the damage from crisis because they are fools or are evil and mentally discard them because they deserved it Or do we pity mentally suffer with their material suffering as they are damned due to said lack of intellect to suffer and we should bare their foolishness due to being kin Should the ones who get well off both in the physical world and the metaphysical one Like somebody doomed to die but is whistleblower of coronavirus from coronavirus crisis feel superiority over others in this crisis just because they are Democrat Hoax republicans Theocratic Iranian leader or bat eating brainwashed CCP member bring to question to the habit of many possibly all where we see one who we view as deserving of punishment with joy but see that of people we love understand relate to have the same nationality ideologies internet website box etc as undeserving of the punishment they receive where in fact this punisher That is the world and what happens does not bother with judgement does whatever it likes and we apply the words deserved and undeserved into the cases on the fact of their being An unlucky fool who due to suffering tragic race related incident from the past will forever be racist trump supporter by the fact of his being An Islamic revolutionist who killed many dissenters because he values his view of his religion and nation over what he thinks are few regrettable but necessary human lives by the fact of his being CCP member who due to cultural tradition and genuine personal enjoyment of the taste of bats eats bats daily causing deadly pandemic by the fact of his being dictatorship is nation that oppresses people by the fact of it being Communism is system that generally doesn work by the fact of it being due to how human nature works by the fact of it being Are you seeing what mean To discard them means that due to being seeing them in the group of evil or stupid every harm they suffer is deserved making it fact of their being which is useful to some people going through this crisis relieving stress enforcing superiority of ones objectively better intellect and heart but makes having to deal with those on their side Smart people who have taken precautions good hearted people friends the progressive and leaders of the free world West who still suffer from the unjudging eyes of the world and what happens and make us have to set did not deserve it too good for this world tragic as facts of their being The alternative option is to remove deserve and underserved from the facts of being of all evil good smart and not where instead we just accept the punishment from whatever happens itself in crisis like the coronavirus as the fact of being thus not giving the individual the usefulness from enjoying the punishment of the deserved but is more able accept the punishment from the undeserving better since neither in this kind of mindset exist instead it purely getting punishment from the world and what happens without judgement that is the fact of being and finding the the world and what happens tragic that it is like that fact of being of ourselves Many probably have option one has as the default mindset and it is understandable since it is useful at times but hope some also consider the usefulness of the latter mindset too okay as let my hands type this out naturally and finished writing this think might have wrote too much and gone off topic

coronavirus is the older sister of Villa Duchesne student Moreover message from the schools to parents circulating on social media warns that the father and sister of the infected patient attended school father daughter dance Saturday night at the Ritz Carlton in Clayton They also apparently attended pre dance gathering at the house of Villa student St Louis County Executive Sam Page said Sunday that the patient family had been told on Thursday to self quarantine at their home in Ladue Page said the patient father had not followed health department instructions Page spoke at news conference Sunday evening County health officials told the man on Sunday Page said that he must remain in his home or they will issue formal quarantine that will require him and the rest of his family to stay in their home by the force of law The Villa Duchesne message advises students and parents If you attended the dance please be attentive to any symptoms you are experiencing The schools are independent Catholic schools in Frontenac Villa is an all girls school for grades seven through while Oak Hill serves coed preschoolers through sixth graders handful of seniors from John Burroughs School also may have been exposed to the virus Saturday when they gathered at the house where the pre dance event had been held earlier according to an email sent Sunday night by Andy Abbott head of John Burroughs School The family who lives at that house includes children who attend Villa and Burroughs The likelihood of any of the Burroughs students contracting the virus is extraordinarily low Abbott wrote adding that the students have been asked not to attend school until we have more information Burroughs has canceled its spring break trip to Italy Abbott said With Missouri first COVID case confirmed on Saturday health officials began the tedious work of determining with whom the woman had close contact since returning home from Italy The woman in her flew into Chicago Hare International Airport on Monday stayed with friend then took an Amtrak train home to St Louis on Wednesday according to Doug Moore spokesman for Page The woman attends an out of state school and had been studying abroad Because she was starting to feel ill the woman contacted the St Louis County Department of Public Health on Thursday Moore said She apparently stayed home and did not have contact with anyone until she was instructed on Friday to go to Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur for testing Hospital staff were notified before the woman arrived so they were able to protect themselves and isolate her from others Officials had said the woman was quarantining herself along with her parents who were not showing symptoms But on Sunday reports about the father daughter dance began circulating We are communicating with the St Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them stated Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill communications director Alice Dickherber in an email We will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment We are committed to the health and safety of our community and we will follow the guidance of public health officials as we plan for the coming days On Saturday state and county officials announced the woman test result as presumptive positive The result still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which takes few days Page said it is highly likely the CDC will confirm it Amtrak On Sunday Amtrak issued news release stating that the woman had been on Amtrak train Amtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train and as precaution we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection and are also working to do thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St Louis stations the statement read The downtown St Louis station called the Gateway Transportation Center is also hub for Greyhound Megabus and Metro St Louis The Gateway Transportation Center is following guidelines to assure the cleanliness of our facility St Louis Comptroller Darlene Green office stated in an email Investigators with the county health department spent several hours Saturday interviewing the woman to determine whether she might have had close contact with anyone else who could be at risk We go through an extensive interviewing process with the person that follows CDC protocols said Spring Schmidt acting co director of the county health department We spent several hours with her yesterday going over her movements and travel history It a difficult process that requires lot of careful interviewing and coaching and memory prompts As investigators learn more Schmidt said they are in contact with CDC officials to determine how far back they should document the woman movements who at risk of exposure and what other health agencies outside of the county may need to be involved The process of determining who needs to be notified checked for symptoms and tested is unfolding Schmidt said Those contacts may lead to more investigations as well It a cascading series of potential calls she said We won know until it starts to move forward and it continues to generate potential contact State health department director Dr Randall Williams was working Sunday alongside county health officials We are providing extra boots on the ground here There are lot of contacts that need to made Williams said We are looking at her travel schedule being on trains and planes and staying in hotels and local contacts Williams said he wanted to stress that only those in close and prolonged contact are at risk It a really important part of the message he said that when we say contact we mean to minutes within feet of the person The CDC website defines close contact as being within approximately feet of an infected person for prolonged period of time or having direct contact with an infected person secretions such as being coughed on No visitors On Sunday the Missouri Veterans Commission restricted access to its seven skilled nursing homes spread across Missouri including one in the St Louis area north of Bellefontaine Neighbors The veterans commission manages total beds The other locations include Cameron Cape Girardeau Mexico Mount Vernon St James and Warrensburg No visitors vendors nor volunteers are allowed in the facilities until further notice according to the commission website Staff is helping families communicate with each other via video chat services Starting Monday Williams said testing kits for COVID will be available commercially Physicians can order tests for their patients who they determine could be at risk he said without having to consult public health officials or meet CDC guidelines that include travel history known contact and symptoms It between the physician and the patient Williams said You can go to the doctor tomorrow and say want test and they don have to use the CDC criteria to order it Using specific throat swab doctors can send the sample to diagnostic lab for testing Williams said All positive cases must be reported to local health departments That could mean dramatic increase in the number of cases reported Williams acknowledged With million that Missouri will receive under emergency federal legislation approved last week he said public health staff will be able to adapt We are clearly prepared he said St Louis County has partly activated its emergency operations center in Ballwin bringing together public health experts paramedics police public information officers and hospital officials to provide the latest information and coordinate efforts The center has been activated during natural disasters and other threats such as the N flu outbreak in It was partly activated Friday and on Sunday was teeming with nearly people We must be prepared and educated and ready to

fjh1ody,In the early days of an infection the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells Those lung cells come in two classes ones that make mucus and ones with hair like batons called cilia Mucus though gross when outside the body helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn dry out The cilia cells beat around the mucus clearing out debris like pollen or viruses Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells which then sloughed off and filled patients airways with debris and fluids and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus That because the earliest studies on COVID have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath That when phase two and the immune system kicks in Aroused by the presence of viral invader our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue When working properly this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way including your healthy tissue So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response Frieman says Even more debris clogs up the lungs and pneumonia worsens During the third phase lung damage continues to build which can result in respiratory failure Even if death doesn occur some patients survive with permanent lung damage According to the WHO SARS punched holes in the lungs giving them honeycomb like appearance and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus too ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fjim1d2,II The preventative measures were poor South Korea were one of the few countries in the world to not ban travelers from China not even quarantining and testing them According to Reuters https www reuters com article us china health southkorea church members of church at center of south koreas coronavirus outbreak visited wuhan kcdc idUSKBN D SEOUL Reuters Some members of church at the center of South Korea coronavirus outbreak visited the Chinese city of Wuhan in January where the disease is believed to have originated the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday Most of the South Korean patients were traced to branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu The church had presence in Wuhan Kwon Jun wook KCDC official confirmed for the first time that some members of the church visited Wuhan during briefing He said it was unclear how many went there and whether the trip played role in the outbreak Emphasis mine Patient and were all community cases who got infected from someone else around the end of Jan and beginning of Feb Assuming that they were only the second link in chain and not somewhere further down we can see that the people who infected them were infected by end of Jan at the latest estimation when there was infected cases in Hubei the Chinese authorities hadn enacted lockdown on Hubei and prevented Chinese nationals from going to other countries on tours and the South Korean government didn even enact quarantine on all travelers from China Even if member of Shincheonji travelling from Wuhan was the only patient the only reason why they would managed to get in and spread the disease undetected in South Korea was because the South Korean government refused to enact proper preventative measures and waited for China to do it for them And judging from the different alarm bells within weeks either there wasn only patient or there was super spreader patient undetected Further genetic testing of the viral strains within the infected population can determine exactly which scenario it was but as of now haven come across such report To sum up part The preventative measures to prevent the epidemic from entering the country were either lacking or done poorly in line with the subsequent poor containment measures and failure to put out the epidemic quickly due to inherent structural problems III The inherent structural problems cult that encourages its followers to hide their potentially epidemic causing disease and not wear masks is allowed to exist and spread their ideology for years https edition cnn com asia shincheonji south korea hnk intl index html cult that encourages its followers to hide their potentially epidemic causing disease was allowed to infiltrate the political and healthcare system so deeply that senior health official in charge of infection prevention in Daegu was discovered to be member after he was tested positive https www latimes com world nation story south korea coronavirus cases surveillance healthcare and political system inexperienced with and reactive instead of proactive in dealing with epidemic having over focused on preparing for when the epidemic had already got out of control having failed to prepare and enact the measures in the most crucial time periods of epidemic development the preventative windows and the containment windows healthcare political and social structure that allows people to skip quarantine and testing even in middle of pandemic of all things when the lives of thousands of people both inside the country and in the world are on the line healthcare political and social structure that condemns other countries for having actually preventing the spread by quarantining testing and treating their people Because human rights Even when thousands are going to be deprived their own basic human rights to be healthy to have medical attention and to be not dead because of such human rights government that did not stand up to protect its people against the slightest pressure from the neighborhood superpower that same human rights violator neighborhood superpower even though that neighborhood superpower later retracted the pressure and enacted the travel restriction themselves But that government would readily kick up storm when other countries actually do what they failed to do The sensationalist media and government authorities keep on shifting all the blames on various other targets other than themselves instead of recognizing the inherent structural problems in the South Korean political and healthcare system and actually fixing them While many many South Korean individuals especially the healthcare professionals have been doing their best to fight back the epidemic it is also undeniable that the political and healthcare structure of South Korea as whole did very poorly in preventing and containing covid resulting in the silent spread of the epidemic among the population around end of January and early February which was the reason why the number of reported infected cases spiked around the end of February,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fkw7udk,Does anyone know if this random facebook repost has any basis in reality It suggests that because there are already two strains of the virus that it even more scary serious than we re already believing it to be gt gt Repost from an ER nurse gt Epidemiology made easy gt gt Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is bigger deal than Seasonal flu Here it is in nutshell hope this helps Feel free to share this to others who don understand gt gt It has to do with RNA sequencing e genetics gt gt Seasonal flu is an all human virus The DNA RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year you get immunity two ways through exposure to virus or by getting flu shot gt gt Novel viruses come from animals the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals sometimes for years watching for mutations Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal pigs in the case of N birds in the case of the Spanish flu But once one of these animal viruses mutates and starts to transfer from animals to humans then it a problem Why Because we have no natural or acquired immunity the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn human and the human immune system doesn recognize it so we can fight it off gt gt Now sometimes the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human for years it only transmission is from an infected animal to human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human once that happens we have new contagion phase And depending on the fashion of this new mutation thats what decides how contagious or how deadly it gonna be gt gt N was deadly but it did not mutate in way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu It RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently too gt gt Fast forward gt gt Now here comes this Coronavirus it existed in animals only for nobody knows how long but one day at an animal market in Wuhan China in December it mutated and made the jump from animal to people At first only animals could give it to person But here is the scary part in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human Scientists call this quick ability slippery gt gt This Coronavirus not being in any form human virus whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity Took off like rocket And this was because Humans have no known immunity doctors have no known medicines for it gt gt And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus changed itself in such way the way that it causes great damage to human lungs gt gt That why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu or N or any other type of influenza this one is slippery AF And it a lung eater And it already mutated AGAIN so that we now have two strains to deal with strain and strain which makes it twice as hard to develop vaccine gt gt We really have no tools in our shed with this History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu gt gt Factoid Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him till the Black Plague passed honestly understand him so much better now Just like us he had no tools in his shed except social isolation gt gt And let me end by saying right now it hitting older folks harder but this genome is so slippery if it mutates again and it will Who is to say what it will do next gt gt Be smart folks acting like you re unafraid is so not sexy right now gt gt flattenthecurve Stay home folks and share this to those that just are not catching on ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
fkfkwbk,This just creates new vectors for the virus to spread Sending everybody to common spot like this just creates the potential for sick people to contaminate the drive through window surfaces or pass the virus to the attendant The next people to drive up even if healthy could get exposed and can end up infected Unless they re going to scrub down the entire window area between customers which very much doubt they will this will just end up nexus of contamination that could spread the virus to healthy people who pass through the location immediately after infected people This could cause long lines of stressed out people in cars waiting to be tested Frustration impatience and anger might boil over then you have people angrily honking their horns and getting out of their vehicles to confront each other creating all kinds of chaos and even more potential exposure Not to mention if the lines are long enough then it could back up into the streets clogging traffic Who knows what kind of chaos then ensues Some people the stupid ones who half listen to news reports will hear drive through Corona testing and wrongfully think they can go to any fast food drive through expecting to get test and end up contaminating that area where food will then be served to hundreds or thousands of people don trust the zit faced kid at the McDs window to know how to handle this nor Management to properly clean the area if infected hillbillies go to the wrong drive through which could occur multiple times daily This is horrifically stupid idea ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fkhe87f,By JOSEPH SERNA ALEX WIGGLESWORTH COLLEEN SHALBY RONG GONG LIN II MARCH AM With supermarkets overrun workplaces clearing out and coronavirus spreading deeper into communities California officials desperately attempted to slow the virus with new restrictions and unified message social distancing Calling the outbreak one of the most historic public health challenges of our time the health officer for Silicon Valley has issued new aggressive ban on public gatherings restricting gatherings of or more unless organizers warn attendees that it poses heightened risk of infection and banning all public and private gatherings of or more Other counties canceled events and introduced new restrictions The state now reports confirmed cases and five deaths with new cases being tallied every few hours But officials say many more have the virus but have not yet been tested Major school districts throughout California including Los Angeles Unified announced shutdowns Friday joining at least states that have ordered complete closures amid escalating attempts to slow the spread of the coronavirus The closure initially is scheduled to last two weeks but firm reopen date will depend on the status of the outbreak which President Trump declared national emergency on Friday Los Angeles County Public Health Department officials confirmed eight new cases of the virus bringing the total to as community spread intensified Three of those cases are thought to be the result of community transmission as the source of exposure is unknown Two of the individuals are hospitalized Public Health Director Dr Barbara Ferrer said Officials say they expect those cases to expand significantly as more people get tested Ferrer said A County got more test kits this week and noted that initial testing limitations have made estimates difficult to gather Orange County on Friday reported new suspected coronavirus cases bringing its total to The new tally came as the Orange County superintendent of schools said he supported suspending all school operations for at least two weeks Courts across California including Los Angeles began grinding to halt as well Santa Clara County where the coronavirus outbreak has hit particularly hard announced delays Friday in many traffic family civil and probate trials as well as some criminal trials In San Diego County all new civil trials were suspended for the next month Orange County will not start new civil trials until May In Ventura County courts will be closed early next week then reopen on limited basis for matters such as urgent criminal cases and temporary restraining orders Contra Costa Superior Court was closed for two weeks Perhaps the greatest symbol of concern over the virus was at supermarkets where many shelves were empty amid panic buying The Ralphs parking lot in Koreatown on Friday morning looked like crowded DMV office Though parking spots were available gridlock reigned as motorists drove in the wrong direction blocked pathways and eased slowly around pedestrians walking every which way Inside the supermarket off rd Street and Vermont Avenue was hive of activity As three cashiers rang up purchases dozens of customers waited in long queues that snaked through the market past the fruit and vegetables displays and down the condiment and milk aisles Many of them pushed shopping carts loaded with gallon jugs of water stacks of frozen meat and cases of ramen noodles One overflowing cart was being pushed by two friends preparing to have their kids home from school for the rest of the month ve been here to Vons across the street we ve been to Target said Monica Boyd whose teenage son will be one of thousands across the county staying home Monday had friends ask me to get them food because they re in the Valley and they re saying everything is kind of cleaned out down there So this is combination of me getting groceries for friends and mostly for my kid Boyd friend Shulanda Rush joined her for the trip property manager in Koreatown Rush said her year old daughter may have to stay with the girl father for the next few weeks because he has more family support to care for her during the workweek The friends knew that people were cleaning out store shelves but it still surprised them to see it in person Most of the ramen in the store was gone So was the powdered milk most of the water toilet paper dried pasta rice and allergy medication It was more packed than pre Super Bowl Cinco de Mayo Thanksgiving or Fourth of July shopping rush m not really worried about what going on think it scares me more that people are panicking so it not business as usual Boyd said They re just like Let come and buy every thing walked here last night to get allergy medicine and it was all gone Allergy medicine does not block viruses What is happening here she said in exasperation just think it ridiculous in general sense The fact that there no toilet paper is insane don understand how that is going to save you from anything More cases were announced nationally include new ones in New York Saturday ,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

fj3gji1,Thanks he is doing quite well with his treatment accidentally replied to you instead of the other comment but can still chime in about reinfection have learned enough in the past week with feline coronavirus to answer that reinfections are quite possible but not fully understood Speaking purely about feline coronavirus and FIP mutated form of FeCoV relapses after proper treatment are possible but it is not known if it just the old infection lying dormant and returning relapse or if it a new infection Generally cats with FIP get weeks of GS treatment and weeks of observation after Within the week post period return of FIP is considered relapse after the week post period is when they are not sure if its relapse or new infection FIP is considered fatal Cats just dont have an immune response to it but the virus puts their immune system into overdrive and white blood cell counts go through the roof The very few who survive less than it not known how or why they survived The treatment with GS goes minumum weeks in order to allow all viruses to die off the GS doesnt kill the virus just prevents replication and treatment must be long enough for all viruses to die off or relapse occurs Viruses are actually not that well understood yet Generally coronaviruses are harmless of common colds are caused by them FeCoV normally presents as just kitty cold flu FIP is rare enough it hasnt been worth funding much research into It wasnt until SARS COVID is SARS and MERS that it seems heavy research into coronaviruses started Hell Remdesivir and GS weren designed for coronaviruses what have researched they were made for Ebola and it just happens they work on coronaviruses very well So in conclusion from what can tell from what can find human reinfection is possiblilty It not known for sure if it new exposure or relapse Too little is known and so many factors come into play including the strength of the immune system of the person There is history of other coronaviruses causing reinfection so dont know if its necessarily fear mongering warning about the possibility ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
fl6qgkj, Translation Peru added this Saturday March the fifth fatality due to the covid coronavirus while confirmed infections increased to more than the previous day and those detained for not respecting the mandatory quarantine totaled since that measure went into effect for six days This was announced by the President of Peru Mart Vizcarra in message to the nation spread through the state channel TV Peru during an extraordinary meeting of his Council of Ministers where the heads of the Armed Forces and the president of the Social Security of Health EsSalud The president reported the first fatality of the pandemic outside of Lima This is an year old man from the northern Piura region bordering Ecuador and offered his condolences to his family Every death is felt by all Peruvians he added Vizcarra also regretted the death of Peruvian Army military man who was deliberately killed by driver who had not respected the quarantine in the southern region of Puno on the border with Bolivia In this sense the president criticized that in some regions the emergency measures decreed by the Government so that people remain in their homes until at least the end of March are not being taken seriously For this reason he specified that since Monday law enforcement agencies have detained more than people who were traveling on public roads without justification violating quarantine or night curfews Only on Friday night for Saturday people were detained the majority of regions such as La Libertad and Piura in the north of the country but also in Moquegua in the south Let hope that sanity and responsibility reach all Peruvians and lower this level of arrests It is not merit to have so many arrests Several regions are taking this state of emergency very lightly and could be the cause and the reason why we do not meet the objective said Vizcarra The head of state made special exhortation to foreign tourists since apparently there have been numerous cases in which they have not respected the quarantine which forces them to stay in their hotel rooms Foreigners who are in our country have the same obligation to comply with the rule Compliance is absolutely for everyone emphasized Vizcarra In the same way all social strata and economic levels There are people who due to their economic level think they have the freedom and freedom to break the norm In no way The virus is absolutely democratic it affects everyone equally It is just as dangerous for everyone it makes no distinction with anyone he added The Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism Edgar squez reported cases of tourists who have not respected the rule in Urubamba Cusco as group of Poles who were expelled on Tuesday from native community Likewise he recommended that they register on portal of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism in order to have list of all the tourists who are stranded in the country Regarding the total closure of the airports decreed from Sunday which prevents the repatriation of travelers such as the hundreds of Spaniards who were scheduled to return to Spain from Lima Vizcarra said that only exceptional cases of people who cannot stay at any site He noted that so far Peruvians have registered to return to the country on humanitarian flights but recommended that they keep their quarantine in the places where they are temporarily We should check one by one so that they do not infect the million Peruvians That is why it is convenient for them to be quarantined wherever they are Vizcarra reiterated We are in state of emergency we are going through period of border closure not only Peru but also neighboring countries and we are going to make that effort to comply with it Only in exceptional cases are we going to make it easier for foreigners to return to their countries as well as Peruvians who are abroad can return to Peru he concluded Peru was one of the countries that reacted earlier and more drastically to the covid crisis the first case of which was confirmed on March and from day when there was already evidence of cases ordered the mandatory quarantine for all population with nightly curfews and the suspension of national and international passenger transport which implies the closure of borders ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

fl3dsm2,A few folks submitting graphs on the sub before were trying to line up the graphs to see how countries were comparing in their growth thought that the idea was interesting but was kinda dubious about just kinda eyeballing things the way the authors appeared to have been and wasn super thrilled about the linear graph that hid most of the growth but didn have an alternative at the time Anyway today figured hey let actually do that right so sat down and pulled up GNU I took all of the countries with at least deaths assuming that the earlier data was likely pretty noisy could get unlucky or really lucky with single person and then aligned their cumulative death graphs to the first day where they reported that their cumulative deaths passed so you can see how they grew from that point Gives an visualization of which countries are seeing faster growth Because this is graphed with log scale on the axis you can see whether the rate of exponential growth is rising or falling based on whether the line is straight one or curving upwards or downwards away from what would be straight line https imgur com tgxLYBX couple takeaways that strike me Spain and Italy don just have lot of deaths they also have high exponential rate of growth that is the slope of the line on the graph is pretty steep Iran had slower rate of growth in deaths and has been slowing things down The US started out more slowly but has seen the rate of growth increase Iran deaths aren growing as quickly as most other countries the exponential growth factor is lower Italy apparently ordered her initial restrictions on February or earlier but that as far back as see news articles https www tgcom mediaset it cronaca lombardia coronavirus primi casi in italia in lombardia due in veneto pronti due centri per la quarantena shtml It now March so days since Italy started quarantine went into place Mean incubation seems to vary but days seems reasonable https www worldometers info coronavirus coronavirus incubation period Mean time until death after onset of symptoms is another days https www the hospitalist org hospitalist article coronavirus updates risk factors death covid identified wuhan patients channel So after days if quarantine measures worked one should really hope to be seeing significant falloff in the exponential rate of spread that should have already happened Looking at the Italy line really don see that which suppose means that countries will need to do more than Italy did if they intend to slow the growth significantly The rate of exponential growth in deaths across countries has generally been slightly decreasing you can see the lines curving down away and not being perfectly straight lines which is good In no countries is the rate of exponential growth decreasing all that much which isn so good source below for any users out there if require pacman install packages pacman pacman load devtools dplyr ggplot ggdark Cairo RColorBrewer Pull the latest

fkgkmw1, The best guess is then period of six to eight weeks of quite significant levels of transmission in the UK with tapering perhaps in July and August so an upsurge in April possible peak in May June and downturn later in the year he said Matt Hancock the Health Secretary said ministers were considering turning to private hospitals for extra bed capacity in the event of major outbreak He said it would be all hands to the pump in the NHS with retired doctors and nurses and volunteers brought in to support healthcare services While the action plan suggested around fifth of workers across the UK could fall sick at any one time the fear among officials was that the figure in the NHS could be far higher given staff members likely exposure to the virus The Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the public could play its part by thinking about what we can to do to avoid too much pressure on the NHS when it comes to using services such as GPs and He said It will be quite important to be self restraining where possible Sir Patrick Vallance the Government chief scientific adviser said the crisis in the UK could last as long as six months from the point that sustained person to person transmission is confirmed So far the UK has seen cases Sir Patrick said You can think of it as roughly two to three months from an outbreak of sustained person to person transmission up to the peak and two to three months after the peak to decline again is the timeline we would be thinking of But Prof Whitty suggested the biggest changes to the running of the NHS such as postponing operations would likely last number of weeks rather than months Business More than six million people could end up off work when the coronavirus peaks the Government has warned in major blow to businesses and the wider economy The worst case scenario would take one fifth of all employees out of the workforce leaving gaping hole in Britain output as crucial workers are stuck at home or in hospital Companies have been offered limited help to delay big tax bills while workers may end up relying on the benefits system particularly if they are self employed Boris Johnson the Prime Minister has said the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy BEIS would be on hand to support companies to make sure they get through the short term difficulties and make sure they have the protections they need He added We are taking each step as it comes He has also announced that under emergency legislation due to be introduced employees diagnosed with the coronavirus will be able to claim statutory sick pay from day one should they be required to self isolate at home Currently employees are only entitled to start claiming after three days However the help on offer to businesses facing slumping sales or shortage of workers is limited according to the coronavirus action plan For businesses facing short term cash flow issues for example as the result of subdued demand an effective mitigation already exists in HMRC Time To Pay system This is offered on case by case basis if firm or individual contacts HMRC about falling behind on their tax the document says This scheme lets companies pay the previous year tax bill in instalments over time rather than in one go Education Children exams face being thrown into chaos if the coronavirus outbreak forces the Government to close schools There are fears that any closures could coincide with the start of the GCSE and level exam season in May The Government page coronavirus action plan stated that if the virus becomes established in the UK action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies such as school closures to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population It added The UK governments education departments planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection Ministers emphasised closures would be last resort but parents and teachers expressed anxiety on social media about the prospect of pupils education being interrupted Martin Clee science teacher from Holmfirth West Yorkshire added on Twitter If Covid goes big and mass school closures happened say towards the end of May beginning of June what happens to exam season So hypothetically speaking if covid goes big and mass school closures happened say towards the end of May beginning of June what happens to exam season Martin Clee martin clee March At least schools are currently closed for deep cleaning following the return of either staff or pupils from one of the countries where the virus has taken hold Around more have only just reopened Official advice was not to close schools but to isolate individual pupils or teachers suspected to have contracted the virus before calling Public Health England But there have been complaints about conflicting advice Parents said they have been left confused by some schools sending pupils home to self isolate while others shut altogether The latest to shut was Hilbre High School in West Kirby Wirral which closed temporarily on Tuesday after parent of pupil tested positive for the virus deep clean of the school will take place before it reopens Some pupils at the school had recently returned from skiing holiday to northern Italy but headteacher Mark Bellamy said the case was not linked to the trip In letter to parents he wrote Last week chose to keep the school open following advice from the Government and Public Health England Today as believe this confirmed case directly impacts on my students and staff am closing the school Whitehall sources said efforts were currently being focused on replacing teachers who had fallen ill by allowing colleagues from other schools to take their place or enabling children to travel to other schools The Government could also relax class sizes beyond the maximum of allowed in primary schools allowing schools where one or more teacher is sick to send children elsewhere Ministers are anxious to avoid widespread closures not only because it would disrupt children education but because it would place wider strain on the workforce with working parents forced to stay at home to look after their children Government influenza pandemic preparedness strategies warned that school closures would place significant pressure on health workers handicapping their ability to come into work at time when they are most needed Teaching unions also expressed concerns over the prospect of an increase in class sizes warning it could even make the risk of infection worse ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
fkdlkg1,Hi m cardiovascular ICU nurse Hope she is doing well There is something you can do for her Remind her to follow her doctor orders This post makes few assumptions namely she is stable and has had routine surgery like valve or CABG Also that she has not been told to not do these things because of another health problem It is meant to be helpful reminder for the average postop heart surgery patient not personal medical advice She should follow her doctor instructions which hopefully include this info If assumptions above are correct then she needs to do her breathing exercises like it was her job They will have given her an incentive spirometer and she needs to be on that several times an hour and get as high as she can Quality of reps better than speed The better shape she can get her lungs in before she has COVID exposure the better her chances Lungs after chest surgery are like wet trash bag You have to work really hard for while to get them opened back up Do those exercises If they re watching TV tell them at every commerical break as minimum Set timer on her phone if you have to slow big reps every hour Encourage her to get the absolute max possible Opening up her lungs will help make the wet trash bag into less hospitable petri dish for bugs as well as maximizing the correctly functioning lung before viral exposure Every little bit of functional lung helps If she smokes quit right this instant It may save her life Breathing exercises will make her cough which is uncomfortable and also why lot of patients don do them but we want you to cough Get rid of that extra fluid and crud Have pillow handy to hug firmly when she needs to cough If her surgery was routine like valve or CABG she will also likely be on what we call an ERAS protocol That enhanced recovery after surgery What that means is get out of bed asap Get up and get moving It may be little uncomfortable so use appropriately timed pain meds Walk little farther each time Sit in the chair few hours day before going back to the bed The more she moves the better and easier the pain will be Ultimately the sooner she gets going the less chance she has of negative outcomes HOWEVER when she stands up use the bracing bra or bracing technique they will have taught her DO NOT put stress on the incision line by using her arms to help her stand She should hug herself or pillow and use her legs only Same sitting down She should not try to walk alone unless her doctor has cleared her that she is okay to do so She should dangle her legs off the bed minute before standing so she doesn get dizzy and fall Ask for help from nurse when she wants to stand Ask the physical therapist to review body mechanics and safe ambulation techniques with her Try to have her get up several times day Last but not least wash those hands She has the right as patient to ask any person walking in her room to wash their hands before they touch her or anything in the room She must monitor this and advocate for her own safety Tell her not to feel bad about demanding that Patients following these simple rules that are given to most all heart surgery post op patients tend to have far better outcomes than those that don Good luck and happy healing ,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Current estimates for this disease put value at over and mortality rate at The flu that we use as an example of the worst plauge in modern history had an value of and mortality rate of No flu pandemic has had an value higher than From the CDC bold emphasis is mine gt What May Happen More cases of COVID are likely to be identified in the coming days including more cases in the United States It also likely that sustained person to person spread will continue to occur including throughout communities in the United States It likely that at some point widespread transmission of COVID in the United States will occur gt Widespread transmission of COVID would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time Schools childcare centers and workplaces may experience more absenteeism Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths Other critical infrastructure such as law enforcement emergency medical services and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed At this time there is no vaccine to protect against COVID and no medications approved to treat it Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy https www cdc gov coronavirus ncov summary html https https www who int docs default source coronaviruse situation reports sitrep covid pdf sfvrsn ccef gt How are COVID and influenza viruses different gt The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses Influenza has shorter median incubation period the time from infection to appearance of symptoms and shorter serial interval the time between successive cases than COVID virus The serial interval for COVID virus is estimated to be days while for influenza virus the serial interval is days This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID Further transmission in the first days of illness or potentially pre symptomatic transmission transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms is major driver of transmission for influenza In contrast while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID virus hours prior to symptom onset at present this does not appear to be major driver of transmission gt The reproductive number the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual is understood to be between and for COVID virus higher than for influenza However estimates for both COVID and influenza viruses are very context and time specific making direct comparisons more difficult Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community For COVID virus initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the age group are low Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults rather than vice versa gt While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar the fraction with severe disease appears to be different For COVID data to date suggest that of infections are mild or asymptomatic are severe infection requiring oxygen and are critical infections requiring ventilation These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection gt Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children pregnant women elderly those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed For COVID our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection gt Mortality for COVID appears higher than for influenza especially seasonal influenza While the true mortality of COVID will take some time to fully understand the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases is between the infection mortality rate the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections will be lower For seasonal influenza mortality is usually well below However mortality is to large extent determined by access to and quality of health care Bullet points are my notes summarizing the above The flu spreads faster That combined with the fact the flu has many year head start explains how it has so many more infections already this season Reproductive number between and The value for was Twenty four studies reported values for the pandemic The median value for was interquartile range IQR Six studies reported seven pandemic values The median value for was IQR Four studies reported seven pandemic values The median value for was IQR Fifty

fjoi2mo, gt think you are very thoroughly misinterpreting the point made and getting upset that am saying things have not Who upset What with the culture that if someone is even slightly harsh in their criticisms more animated then the other party it means they are mad or upset gt When say us am referring to those who are having conversation in this particular thread right now not women or people as whole mean not only does this not change my point much at all trying to justify it by saying meant us in very interpretive way doesn mean much so am bit confused why you need to clarify this gt If everyone understood the above concepts then the issue wouldnt exist because noone would do it m saying that the people who judge emotions are generally the ones slinging all the types of mud Those of us discussing it right now and recognising there is problem are more than likely not the ones telling folks they are virgins with tiny dick But that is literally what my argument is about was talking about how people who claim to be in support of men expressing their issues and emotions don realize that shit like tiny dick or lawl virgin are the host of lot of insecurities in men and not many people talk about it in that context It is easier saying Boys need to cry more instead of offering your shoulder to cry on for example and idk how well at least they recognize the problem means anything here gt Toxic masculinity as phrase might not be term you like but it has the word toxic in front of it That the bad word not masculinity Im sorry but can you stop with the belittlement First was getting upset and now it is don like the word when that is very dismissive approach to my arguments don like it for all the reasons listed and many more it not that don like it because it has toxic in front of masculinity and that it You can say that the toxic component is the bad word and it isn attacking masculinity as whole but that doesn change the association and it use as slur in LOT of situations so am unsure why you are going all in on this gt That what adjectives exist for to provide definition or clarification to word Condescension count number Explaining what an adjective when that doesn even take what said into consideration isn my only argument presented and is SUPER fucking rude way to talk to someone But ok you do you guess gt In this instance what its actually doing is narrowing the elements of masculinity that are being referred to because there absolutely are parts of masculine behaviour that are toxic But it isn narrowing down anything because it refers to masculinity as whole and nothing gender neutral That doesn even begin to consider the implications and associations made which such term at this point and its use by bigots but guess that doesn matter to you gt Just as there can be toxic feminine behaviours or toxic religious behaviours Yet toxic religious beliefs and toxic femininity aren as house hold as toxic masculinity is so idk your point here This is akin to saying Influenza and Coronavirus are getting the same coverage gt Thinking part of something is bad does not inherently make the whole bad and jumping to that conclusion is actually an unhealthy attitude that can make it exceedingly difficult to have productive and constructive conversations about the issues Idk if you are the best to talk about productive and constructive conversation when you spoke down to me three distinct times in this very comment and are hyper focusing on one singular aspect of my argument as if said nothing else Pot calling the kettle black bit to much for my taste here gt To me it feels almost like form of denial Saying that toxic masculinity exists is not the same as saying that men are bad or that being masculine is problem like how you wanna lecture me about jumping to conclusions yet feel confident to baselessly claim that am claiming toxic masculinity doesn exist never said it doesn and specifically said hate toxic masculinity as term for variety of ways and am glad you are aware that it is suppose to talk about society and not just men but wouldn Harmful gender roles fit that narrative FAR better and less open to bigots co opting it for their own use But please go on how exactly does criticizing something mean am denying something The only one denying anything here is you gt To come to that conclusion is to wilfully misinterpret what is being said and what is being meant Uhh do you have any rational arguments why that that is the case because these haughty assertions don do it for me gave NUMEROUS other arguments you stepped over like dead rat on the side of the road and you STILL felt it appropriate to talk down to me so gt We are however think both in agreement here that it is massive issue that has so many root causes and sources Yeah and the inflammation in this conversation based on terminology alone proves this issue is complicated but removing such disliked term should be the first step and saying wElL yOu ArE wIlLfUlLy MiSiNtErPrEtInG iT hardly helps shit gt Much though it would be lovely to click our fingers to fix it it something that will require changing the way we think and that generally requires raising new generation with that thought model and letting the older generations shitty biases die off with them Yeah maybe you should look to change the way you think

fg5edfl,Yes but the major difference here from Ebola is that the epicenter is now in China the world most populous country and one which poses particularly acute complexity due to whole myriad of issues most in the West who know nothing about China naively underestimate The capacity for this thing to spread is absolutely massive in comparison to Ebola Unlike SARS which was contained in much tighter region and when there were relatively much fewer Chinese roaming abroad the reach of the new coronavirus will extend to every corner of the globe The incentive for local provincial officials to lie to the central government on fear of punishment for bearing bad news the strict penalties put in place for citizens expressing criticisms or exposing truths the eight hour delay of enforcing the quarantine on Wuhan the arrogant denial of the virus capacity to spread from human to human all of this several weeks before the official quarantine allowed this thing to get much worse than it needed be Chinese citizens themselves are rightly pissed off that their government has basically allowed the infected to wander to every province of China and these citizens face up to seven years of prison for expressing these criticisms People in China being unable to directly criticize those who allowed this to happen will inevitably search for scapegoats as people do everywhere and thus many innocent people will die due to the hysteria It is not uncommon for doctors in China to be stabbed if loved one dies under their care regardless of whether it was their fault There is an incentive to project blame into something as result of being unable to unleash it elsewhere We will likely see more of this The doctors themselves are on the front lines of hell and will be treated like cannon fodder by the government being under equipped One thing is for certain those responsible for allowing this to spread will never apologize to the world or the people of China They will attempt to cover it up with ostentatious displays of power that ultimately mean nothing and will do little to help the situation now that the horse has left the barn This situation is unlike the Ebola or SARS crisis for the very reason we are talking about China in not China of the early The unique problems posed by China at this time are usually completely missed by anyone unfamiliar with how it actually handles problems of this nature and the amount of influence it now exerts over the globe to accommodate its always special needs which was evident in the WHO obsequious kowtowing to the Chinese government for days ahead of finally announcing the emergency The United States has been similarly meek and slow to respond to this gates should have been closed days ago at the least Again for those who understand how China works in its own xenophobic approach to the world they would know China would be the first to close its own gates to passengers coming from country known to be carrying disease of this sort But the double standard prevails and the world must treat China as if it were special even when it would not extend the favor if it were on the other end of the bargain This is the nature of how things work in terms of international relations with China do worry about the xenophobic backlash against Chinese Since most Americans are ignorant of anything beyond its borders let alone Asia many of them will lump all East Asians into one category and equally treat them poorly But you can bet the same thing would happen in China tenfold toward foreigners should they be associated with country carrying virus like this This does not excuse the behavior It does suggest nobody in this is innocent have Chinese significant other home for the holiday shut in at in her small Ningbo home also have several friends in China whom worry about This is unique situation and should not be compared to previous outbreaks It may be less severe or more in the end but collapsing these virus outbreaks down into conceptual categories betrays mental distortion that smells to me like defense mechanism to avoid the complex truth of the situation ,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

fkkbt90, This is being shared around Facebook and needs solid debunking that can link to if anybody qualified has the time m almost certain it entirely made up in the imagination of some troll but it is being shared widely so needs dealing with VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ AND SHARE From young researcher who had been transferred from Shenzhen to Wuhan to collaborate with the task force that is fighting the coronavirus epidemic we receive and willingly transmit to all of this clear simple and accessible information which describe exactly what it is the virus how it transfers from one person to another and how it can be neutralized in everyday life Corona virus infection does not cause cold with dripping nose or catarrhal cough but dry and dry cough this is the easiest thing to know The virus does not resist heat and dies if exposed to temperatures of degrees therefore often consume hot drinks such as tea herbal tea and broth during the day or simply hot water hot liquids neutralize the virus and it is not difficult to drink them Avoid drinking ice water or eating ice cubes or snow for those in the mountains children For those who can do it expose yourself to the sun The virus crown is quite large diameter about nanometers therefore any type of mask can stop it in normal life special masks are not needed On the other hand the situation is different for doctors and health professionals who are exposed to heavy virus loads and have to use special equipment If an infected person sneezes in front of you three meters away they will drop the virus on the ground and prevent it from landing on you When the virus is found on metal surfaces it survives for about hours So when you touch metal surfaces such as handles doors appliances supports on trams etc wash your hands well and disinfect them carefully The virus can live nested in clothes and fabrics for about hours normal detergents can kill it For clothes that cannot be washed every day if you can expose them to the sun and the virus will die How it manifests itself The virus first installs itself in the throat causing inflammation and dry throat sensation this symptom can last for days the virus travels through the humidity present in the airways descends into the trachea and installs in the lung causing pneumonia This step takes about days Pneumonia occurs with high fever and difficulty breathing it is not accompanied by the classic cold But you may have the feeling of drowning In this case contact your doctor immediately How can you avoid it Virus transmission occurs mostly by direct contact touching tissues or materials on which the virus is present washing hands frequently is essential The virus only survives on your hands for about ten minutes but in ten minutes many things can happen rub your eyes or scratch your nose for example and allow the virus to enter your throat So for your own good and for the good of others wash your hands very often and disinfect them You can gargle with disinfectant solution that eliminates or minimizes the amount of virus that could enter your throat in doing so you eliminate it before it goes down into the trachea and then into the lungs disinfect the PC keyboard and mobile phones The new coronavirus NCP may not show signs of infection for many days before which it cannot be known if person is infected But by the time you have fever and or cough and go to the hospital your lungs are usually already in fibrosis and it too late Taiwanese experts suggest doing simple check that we can do on our own every morning Take deep breath and hold your breath for more than seconds If you successfully complete it without coughing without discomfort sense of oppression etc this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs indicating essentially no infection In such critical times do this check every morning in clean air environment These are serious and excellent advice from Japanese doctors who treat COVID cases Everyone should make sure that their mouth and throat are moist never DRY Drink few sips of water at least every minutes WHY Even if the virus gets into your mouth water or other liquids will sweep it away through the esophagus and into the stomach Once in the belly Gastric acid in the stomach will kill all the virus If you don drink enough water more regularly the virus can get into your trumpets and lungs It is very dangerous Share this information with your family friends and acquaintances for solidarity and civic sense ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

fkyu5as,So an Indian just spent half an hour listening to the speech and the article doesn even mention lot of the content of the speech wanna clarify few common misconceptions specify the exact contents of the speech The purpose of this lockdown is not to lockdown It mostly to test how prepared the Indian public is for lockdown He didn say it but assume it easing them into quarantine He phrased it like the lockdown is optional but harsh words coming from the PM him stating he gonna ask state and district governments to help enforce the curfew really means it ll probably be quite effective As personal anecdote several streets in big cities are already completely free of traffic Indians are aware of the dangers and already taking precautions meaning this likely won be as difficult to enforce as you might think He heavily advocated social distancing measures over the next few weeks as well as telling people falling complacent is the worst thing they can do He emphasized how the disease is fatal has no cure vaccine and from other countries the only effective response is quarantine He praised essential workers including delivery people and grocery store workers lot and requested citizens to assist respect them over the upcoming months This included actions like only going to the doctors if absolutely necessary try calling doctor if you have an ailment checkup that isn necessary to reduce the load on them and cheering for minutes at pm on Sunday nd March to show appreciation He created an economic task force to analyze the impacts of the virus The task force will stay in contact with all relevant stakeholders and make necessary decisions soon He requested people to take the plight of servants into account informal service sector such as maids is pretty big in India He essentially meant that if someone who serves you like maid cannot come to work in the upcoming weeks be very humane and take their conditions into account before firing them edit for more information He also mentioned panic buying and how there really no need He talked about how everyone needs to help themselves and others within the communities He encouraged people to call new people everyday to inform them of coronavirus and necessary measures ,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

fgapm4s,They are not carrying the same thing to inject into the cell Viruses may have genomes made up of RNA or DNA and the first known example of both you cited but that doesn mean they can just take bits and pieces from anything at random Mononegavirales is not Rabies Mononegavirales is an order of viruses including anything from Ebola to measles Rabies included They don carry the same thing to infect into the cell Coronaviruses have an positive sense RNA genome meaning it RNA is ready to be translated into proteins Rabies has negative sense RNA genome meaning that it must first be transcribed into messenger RNA before it gets translated into proteins Additionally these differences in RNA processing means they need different factors and methods to replicate Packaging viral genome is an incredibly specific process Virions have different sizes and shapes and proteins of different charges This means each virus particle can only fit in in this case RNA of specific size and shape and charge as well For coronavirus to gain some Rabies RNA it would need to lose some of its own even if we ignore the shape and charge constraints As mentioned before these viruses require different factors and methods to complete replication cycles Not only would coronavirus have to lose RNA vital for its survival it would gain completely useless RNA from Rabies This also completely ignores the genome structure Both viruses have one single chain or RNA This makes it basically impossible for them to mix and match genes as there isn a mechanism available to cut and paste in this manner and certainly no mechanism to ensure cuts happened both in frame for protein translation and at the end of protein This swapping of genomes most regularly happens in viruses with segmented genome like Influenza virus IAV the common flu has its RNA on different fragments Flu can change swap mutate by exchanging segments with related flu viruses The reason this works is because they only swap with related viruses so each segment has the same function These segments have the same size shape and charge Once RNA or DNA is injected into the cell much more than two things can happen The options you suggested certainly can happen or the cell produces more virus and then dies or the virus goes dormant in the cell for some viruses like Herpes this happens etc amp B The amount of misinformation in this sub is absolutely astounding don expect people to understand how viruses replicate or the purpose of size shape charge in organising virions etc There would be no reason to know this unless you spent far too long studying them have as job for years But when people try and pass of scientific knowledge when not having any understanding of it again m not blaming anyone for not knowing such niche things it does more harm than good Yes this outbreak is scary but there is no need to make it worse by fuelling fears of mixing with deadlier viruses like Rabies or HIV like saw last night when these things literally can happen There is enough fear and death occurring as result without making it worse ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

fhr83ly,Full Text Health officials expected to order anyone with the sniffles to self isolate at home if the virus is not contained Anyone suffering flu like symptoms could be ordered to self isolate for fortnight if the number of coronavirus cases in the UK hits the hundreds in what would be dramatic shift in Government strategy Over the last week hospitals across the country have created isolation pods to ensure that anyone tested for the virus is kept away from other patients with efforts to track all close contacts of confirmed cases But The Telegraph understands that after series of high level meetings health officials are expected to change tack and simply order anyone with possible symptoms of flu to stay at home if the virus is not contained That means millions of Britons with coughs and colds could end up quarantined at home as part of attempts to dampen down spread of the virus It comes as Chinese tourist visiting France became the first person to die of coronavirus in Europe and another GP surgery was shut in England Eight out of the nine people in Britain to have contracted the virus to date have now recovered and left hospital following treatment The five members of ski group infected by Steve Walsh the businessman at the centre of the UK outbreak have said they had recovered quickly Writing in The Sunday Telegraph Dominic Raab the Foreign Secretary today called for more international cooperation to prevent Coronavirus turning into global pandemic The Telegraph understands that senior managers have been told that the NHS could stop testing patients once around cases have been confirmed across the country if there is evidence of sustained transmission within the UK The WHO advises countries to carry out detailed investigation of at least the first confirmed cases of any pandemic Britain Pandemic Influenza Response Plan sets out protocols for ensuring isolation and treatment for the first few cases so that detailed information can be gathered about any novel virus But it says the approach should be changed as soon as there is evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus ie cases not linked to any known or previously identified cases The health service is already struggling to cope with the number of tests for the virus it is carrying out In the last week the number tested has quadrupled with now carried out up from week ago The NHS has the capacity to carry out tests day but on Thursday alone it carried out tests Prof Chris Whitty England chief medical officer has said the current approach aims to contain and delay the spread of the virus as much as possible in order to buy time while treatments and vaccines are researched But if there are cases of onward transmission in this country and it becomes sustained the strategy will shift to mitigation as the NHS would not be able to cope with vast numbers of patients undergoing tests If large numbers fall ill but suffer mild symptoms sending them to hospital when isolation could not be maintained would increase the risk of spreading the disease among the vulnerable The Foreign Secretary said the British government is helping the World Health Organisation to train rapid response teams and local emergency medics in Asia and Africa to fight the virus and has donated million to the WHO Flash Appeal to stop its spread Experts say if the situation becomes pandemic percent of the population could get the virus and up to people might die However officials stress that it is still possible that the UK could avoid sustained transmission One NHS manager in London said services were struggling to cope with demand for tests with staff spending hours waiting to ensure those undergoing the checks remained in isolation with ambulances used to ferry them home She said hospitals were overwhelmed by demand to keep up with tests with nurses being warned that they may have to test people in their homes in future On Thursday the head of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens warned that many more people may be forced to self isolate as part of efforts to stop Coronavirus spreading in Britain Prof Neil Ferguson professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College has warned that the world is in the early phases of global pandemic He said Britain is probably only picking up around one in three cases focusing on those coming in to the country when cases may have arrived and gone undetected before restrictions set in Surveillance has started in hospitals across the UK of pneumonia cases that will give us proper picture he said Our best estimate is that transmission in the UK will get going in the next few weeks unless we are very lucky probably peaking to months after that he said If it truly establishes itself in terms of true person to person transmission it will behave like flu pandemic maybe up to percent of the population being affected but most of those people having very mild symptoms He suggested that people in the UK could die from it in the next months based on estimates of per cent mortality rate and an infection rate of percent of the population The year old Chinese man who died from the virus in France flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on January but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid Coronavirus The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat Claude Bernard hospital northern Paris His daughter is also in hospital but French authorities say she is likely to make good recovery In Portsmouth the Kingston Crescent Surgery became the latest to shut for deep cleaning until further notice on Friday after woman suspected to have the virus walked in after falling ill The woman is said to have felt unwell some time after arriving in Britain at Gatwick Airport The closure is the latest to hit string of surgeries and health centres around the country including Islington in north London and Taunton in Somerset after being attended by patients with suspected Coronavirus At the same time the last of those quarantined at Arrowe Park in the Wirral after returning from China have now been allowed home Mr Walsh year old Scout leader from Hove in East Sussex contracted Coronavirus on business trip to Singapore and on his way back stopped off at ski resort in France where five other Britons were subsequently infected In statement the group who were treated at the Royal Free Hospital and St Thomas Hospital in London said All of our group including the six in other countries have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation We understand the virus can be dangerous for some but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people Health Secretary Matt Hancock said am pleased that of the individuals who tested positive for Coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital Again this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan Coronavirus want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public

fhkdgp8, Meanwhile on the other side of the Pacific Ocean as the Sino American relationship continues moving into uncharted territory the fact that for the Superpower politics are not merely about grand claims that no one has right to comment on the internal affairs of such nations all of these happenings in Hong Kong and Taiwan which Beijing emphasizes are solely matter of China internal affairs have direct impact on the unfolding fate of our own nation And at this very juncture The Axelrod befuddled as usual is for his pains also having to deal with an America led by man who repeatedly trumps him by virtue of his own unpredictability here the author alters the Chinese transliteration of Trump name to read extremely befuddling that is someone who stumps everyone What you end up with is one big mess There is proliferation of online comments that claim He is aiding and abetting the Yankees pursue their Imperialist Steadfast Desire to See Us Destroyed In other words canny commentators are suggesting that He is helping the S achieve the very things it could never have dreamed of accomplishing itself This is not just way to ridicule him it is profoundly painful reality for all of us Secondly the power holders have in recent years accelerated their attempts to stifle all signs that China might be developing civil society Censorship increases by the day the impact of which is to weaken and obliterate those very things that can and should play positive role in alerting society to critical issues In response to the coronavirus for instance at first the authorities shut down public disquiet and outspoken commentary via censorship they then simply shut down entire cities First people hearts die and then Death stalks the living It takes no particular leap of the imagination to appreciate that along with all of these acts of crude expediency soulless pragmatism can make even greater political inroads Given the fact that the country is in effect run by people nurtured on the Politics of the Sent Down Youth that is of the Cultural Revolution era today leaders came of age during the late and early a period of unparalleled political cynicism this is hardly remarkable After all we are living in time when what once passed for measure of public decency and social concern has long quit the stage One could go so far as to say that from the highest echelon to the very bottom of the system this lot represent the worst political team to have run China since That is why believe that it is imperative that the nation act on and truly put into practice Article of the Constitution That is to say we ourselves should advance Five Key Demands Lift the ban on independent media and publishing Put an end to the secret police surveillance of the Internet and allow people their right to freedom of speech so they can express themselves with clear conscience Allow citizens to enjoy their right to demonstrate as well as the freedom of assembly and association Respect the basic universal rights of our citizens in particular their right to vote in open elections And fifthly It should also be matter of pressing urgency that an independent body be established to investigate the origins of the coronavirus epidemic to trace the cover up and to determine the responsible parties and to analyze the systemic origins of the crisis Then and only then after the coronavirus epidemic has passed can we truly engage in what should be meaningful Post Anti Virus War Reconstruction New Era of Resuscitated Court Politics Added to this is the re emergence of court politics or palace intrigue The lurch towards the totalitarian along with concomitant ratcheting up of policies aimed at insinuating the Communist Party into every aspect of civil government has as we have noted in the above resulted in the near paralysis of normal bureaucratic operations The system lacks any real sources of positive motivation and the concentration of authority along with the concomitant impotence of actual power means that the Tail or underlings can all too readily Wag the Dog ergo the existence of Security Commission that imposes harsh punishments as part of the mechanisms used to keep the show on the road and the bureaucratic game ticking over Due to the lack of freedom of speech and the absence of modern bureaucratic system let alone the absence of anything even approaching His Majesty Loyal Opposition the whip itself knows no restraint and the National Security Commission established by Xi rules through an iron fist with each layer of bureaucracy answering upwards until it reaches the pinnacle The Sole Responsible Person And that individual is but man of flesh and blood who cannot possibly be across all aspects of governance Party State system that has no checks or balances nor indeed rational allocation of duties and responsibilities inevitably results in the rule of clique of trusted lieutenants Hence you have the equivalent of court and the politics pertaining to one Put in the most obvious way the collective leadership with its Nine Dragons Ruling the Waters prior to Xi Jinping rule there were nine members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee Xi leadership saw this number reduced to seven and its concomitant claque of rulers is no longer operable And with its relative decline in efficacy the One Leader inner circle becomes state within state something that the Yankees have taken to calling the deep state Following the founding of the People Republic in bureaucracy was established to carry out basic administrative tasks Even Mao was able to tolerate someone like Premier Zhou Enlai running his part of the government With the appearance of the Revolutionary Committees and Security Organs which replaced the police and the judicial system as whole during the Cultural Revolution from until the that existing system was overthrown but in the four decades after Cultural Revolution policies were formally rejected from for the most part modicum of balance existed between the roles of Party leader and state leader that is between the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier who was head of the State Council and the formal structures of government Even though the Party and State were still melded the state bureaucracy had the task of implementing Party directives It is only in the last few years that new kind of hermetically sealed governance has come to the fore and due to the nature of hidden court politics it is one that has enabled sole power holder while giving license to the darkest kinds of plotting and scheming It is rulership structure that stifles change and forecloses the kinds of changes that could support regularized forms of governance With the way ahead reduced to something akin to political locked in syndrome and since meaningful retreat is all but impossible the system is under constant strain It is virtually impossible for anyone to act in any meaningful fashion Instead all are forced to look on in impotent frustration as the situation deteriorates This may well go on until things are simply beyond salvaging Faced with such situation the social economy ends up in tatters and the basic ethical web of society as whole is rent by the prevailing winds of political fashion so much so that people already fragile sense of citizenship ends up being further depleted In the absence of anything that can meaningfully be called civil society there is no hope that any kind of mature politics can evolve The brittleness of the situation is such that whenever there is the slightest disturbance let alone major disaster everyone is endangered and they are certainly powerless to help each other That is why what may start out as molehill can all too readily become mountain The present chaos in Wuhan has thrown Hubei into confusion but as we have noted before the root cause of the expanding problem is in Beijing The One who devotes himself energetically to Protecting the Mountains and Rivers and Maintaining Rulership Over the Mountains and Rivers of China Rivers and Mountains is poetic expression for China as unified entity under authoritarian control His self interest is not grounded in the sovereignty of the people nor in system of governance that is about building nation on the basis of civilization or freedom The end result of His style of rulership is as commentators on the Internet have widely remarked of late that although Major Tasks Can Be Accomplished by Concentrating Power in times of crisis the reality is that Major Mishaps Are Also Generated by Overly Concentrated Power The coronavirus epidemic is clear demonstration of this ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

fkv4zbl, May GENEVA WHO today called on scientists national authorities and the media to follow best practices in naming new human infectious diseases to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations economies and people In recent years several new human infectious diseases have emerged The use of names such as swine flu and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors says Dr Keiji Fukuda Assistant Director General for Health Security WHO This may seem like trivial issue to some but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected We ve seen certain disease names provoke backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities create unjustified barriers to travel commerce and trade and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals This can have serious consequences for peoples lives and livelihoods Diseases are often given common names by people outside of the scientific community Once disease names are established in common usage through the Internet and social media they are difficult to change even if an inappropriate name is being used Therefore it is important that whoever first reports on newly identified human disease uses an appropriate name that is scientifically sound and socially acceptable The best practices apply to new infections syndromes and diseases that have never been recognized or reported before in humans that have potential public health impact and for which there is no disease name in common usage They do not apply to disease names that are already established The best practices state that disease name should consist of generic descriptive terms based on the symptoms that the disease causes g respiratory disease neurologic syndrome watery diarrhoea and more specific descriptive terms when robust information is available on how the disease manifests who it affects its severity or seasonality g progressive juvenile severe winter If the pathogen that causes the disease is known it should be part of the disease name g coronavirus influenza virus salmonella Terms that should be avoided in disease names include geographic locations g Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Spanish Flu Rift Valley fever people names g Creutzfeldt Jakob disease Chagas disease species of animal or food g swine flu bird flu monkey pox cultural population industry or occupational references g legionnaires and terms that incite undue fear g unknown fatal epidemic WHO developed the best practices for naming new human infectious diseases in close collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health OIE and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO and in consultation with experts leading the International Classification of Diseases ICD The new best practices do not replace the existing ICD system but rather provide an interim solution prior to the assignment of final ICD disease name As these best practices only apply to disease names for common usage they also do not affect the work of existing international authoritative bodies responsible for scientific taxonomy and nomenclature of microorganisms ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fk8uxwv,In all honesty the virus originated here in the States It was what we had back in Late November Early December Those of you who were sick when you look at the symptoms of Corona Virus viral pneumonia and understand from your own experience how it possible to have Pneumonia AND dry cough it all lines up perfectly If you look at the timeline shortly after the disease ravaged the US during the Hong Kong protests Mystery Illness appeared The Mystery Illness was reported on for days and during those days lot of people speculated it was Chinese information PsyOp to convince the protesters to stop protesting Then all of sudden the disease stopped being reported on weeks passed and all of sudden New Virus has originated in Wuhan China Interesting weeks after the mystery illness appeared in Hong Kong which was protesting Extradition to the Mainland The Actual First Case of New Disease manifests in China Now of course the follow up questions would be Why didn the US identify the virus and Why would the media specifically choose to ignore Western Origination to put the fault on China Well the US doctors are reflection of the US citizens Most just going along with the norm not thinking outside the box and considering the timing automatically assuming it was just the flu It took the paranoia of Hong Kong doctors in the throw of soft political revolution to investigate the inconsistent symptoms with modern known flus So why blame China Well if this disease originated in the West namely the USA if the rest of the world panics which it is any economic shortfall experienced they re going to demand financial compensation The powers that be the financial elite that control the world monetary supply don want to have to dip into their coffers to supplicate their ignorance inaction The easiest safest cheapest route is to blame it all on China The world doesn expect China to pay us back for their lack of containment if it results in fear based escalation resulting in economic setbacks and downslides amp B Short Story of it is We ve already had this disease It ran it course through the US this past winter and the people who are getting it now are just the late stage tail end lucky ones who didn catch it on the first go around Ultimately we have already been through the worst the Virus has to offer but sadly we now have to go through the worst the fear of the uninformed can enact upon ourselves ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

fhfcwns, Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least other countries have flaws and do not work properly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the D in Atlanta But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the D which will mean several days delay in getting results The D announced last week that it had begun shipping about kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly more to labs in more than other countries Each kit can test about to specimens from patients the agency said Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed On trial runs in some states the kits produced results that were inconclusive Dr Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at news conference on Wednesday Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like Dr Messonnier said She said the D was working closely with the states and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem There have been confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far About evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China Still others are under self quarantine at their homes The flawed test kits are separate issue from the mislabeled samples in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital woman who was sick from the coronavirus More than people have died nearly all of them in China where there are more than confirmed cases blocked their script and copy pasted ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
fho3bc2,Either way she notes that liver failure was never the sole cause of death for SARS patients By the time the liver fails she says oftentimes you ll find that the patient not only has lung problems and liver problems but they may also have kidney problems By then it becomes systemic infection Kidney It all connected Yes your kidneys are caught up in this mess too Six percent of SARS patients and full quarter of MERS patients suffered acute renal injury Studies have shown the novel coronavirus can do the same It may be relatively uncommon feature of the disease but it is fatal one Ultimately percent of SARS patients with acute renal impairment died according to study in Kidney International Like the liver your kidneys act as filter your blood Each kidney is filled with about of microscopic distilling units called nephrons These nephrons have two main components filter to clean the blood and little tubes that return the good stuff back to your body or send the waste down to your bladder as urine It the kidney tubules that seem to be most affected by these zoonotic coronaviruses After the SARS outbreak the WHO reported that the virus was found in kidney tubules which can become inflamed It not uncommon to detect virus in the tubules if it in your bloodstream says Kar Neng Lai professor emeritus at the University of Hong Kong and consultant nephrologist at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital As your kidneys are continuously filtering blood sometimes the tubular cells can trap the virus and cause transient or milder injury How Flu Viruses Attack See how flu virus attacks mutates and becomes contagious perhaps resulting in an outbreak or even pandemic That injury could become lethal if the virus penetrates the cells and begins to replicate But Lai who was also member of the first group of researchers reporting on SARS and contributed to the Kidney International study says there was no evidence that the SARS virus was replicating in the kidney That finding Lai says suggests acute kidney injury in SARS patients might be due to diverse set of causes including low blood pressure sepsis drugs or metabolic disturbance Meanwhile the more severe cases that led to acute renal failure showed signs of you guessed it cytokine storm Acute renal failure can also sometimes be brought on by antibiotics multi organ failure or being connected to ventilator for too long Everything is connected Pregnancy and coronavirus It the great irony of the Twitter age that we know too little about the novel coronavirus as we drown in information updates about it Medical journals have published several studies about this outbreak some more vetted than others as researchers rush to feed the maw Meanwhile news outlets are reporting every development All this information whirls around the internet where discerning fact from fiction is notorious challenge This is really unprecedented in terms of the up to the minute reporting on what going on in these studies Rasmussen says It really tricky trying to sort through all of the information and figure out what really supported what speculative and what plain wrong For example last week doctors at hospital in Wuhan reported that two infants tested positive for the novel coronavirus one just hours after birth Naturally this troubling headline spread across news organizations given it raised questions of whether pregnant women can infect their unborn children in utero or whether the disease can be transmitted during birth or through breast milk But let pump the breaks Mother to infant transmission wasn observed with SARS nor MERS despite numerous cases involving pregnant women Plus there are other ways newborn could catch the coronavirus Rasmussen says such as by being born at hospital overrun with infected patients during hectic emergency In fact new study published Thursday in The Lancet offers preliminary evidence that the coronavirus cannot be passed from mother to child In the report researchers observed nine women in Wuhan who had COVID pneumonia Some of the women had pregnancy complications but all cases resulted in live births without evidence of transmitting the infection While this study doesn completely rule out the possibility of transmission during pregnancy it underscores the need to exercise caution in speculating about this disease There needs to be high standard of evidence before you can say that happening definitively and certainly before you start making changes to how cases are managed clinically or in terms of public policy Rasmussen says Frieman agrees He hopes this epidemic will prompt more funding for coronavirus research like the recent pledges from the European Union and the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation But Frieman wants the

fkmk3rl,I got this message from my land lady and think some of the info is wrong Can get some confirmation here Yes This is good Great information about the virus Let spread facts so we can all help each other Internal email for staff in St George Hospital Virus Detection The simplest way to distinguish Coronavirus from Common Cold is that the COVID infection does not cause cold nose or cough with cold but it does create dry and rough cough The virus is typically first installed in the throat causing inflammation and feeling of dryness This symptom can last between and days The virus typically then travels through the moisture present in the airways goes down to the trachea and installs in the lungs causing pneumonia that lasts about or days Pneumonia manifests with high fever and difficulty breathing The Common Cold is not accompanied but there may be choking sensation In this case the doctor should be called immediately Experts suggest doing this simple verification every morning Breathe in deeply and hold your breath for seconds If this can be done without coughing without difficulty this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs indicating the absence of infection It is recommended to do this control every morning to help detect infection Prevention The virus hates heat and dies if it is exposed to temperatures greater than C Therefore hot drinks such as infusions broths or simply hot water should be consumed abundantly during the day These hot liquids kill the virus and are easy to ingest Avoid drinking ice water or drinks with ice cubes Ensure that your mouth and throat are always wet never DRY You should drink sip of water at least every minutes WHY Even when the virus enters water or other liquids through the mouth it will get flushed through the oesophagus directly into the stomach where gastric acids destroy the virus If there is not enough water the virus can pass into the trachea and from there to the lungs where it is very dangerous For those who can sunbathe The Sun UV rays kill the virus and the vitamin is good for you The Coronavirus has large size diameter of nanometers so face masks can stop it no special face masks are needed in daily life If an infected person sneezes near us stay feet meters away to allow the virus fall to the ground and prevent it from falling on you When the virus is on hard surfaces it survives about hours therefore when hard surfaces such as doors appliances railings etc are touched hands should be washed thoroughly and or disinfected with alcoholic gel The virus can live nested in clothes and tissues between and hours Common detergents can kill it Things that cannot be washed should be exposed to the Sun and the virus will die The transmission of the virus usually occurs by direct infection touching fabrics tissues or materials on which the virus is present Washing your hands is essential The virus survives on our hands for only about minutes In that time many things can happen rubbing the eyes touching the nose or lips This allows the virus to enter your throat Therefore for your good and the good of all wash your hands very often and disinfect them You can gargle with disinfectant solutions e Listerine or Hydrogen Peroxide that eliminate or minimize the amount of virus that can enter the throat Doing so removes the virus before it goes down to the trachea and then to the lungs Disinfect things touched often cellphone keyboard mouse car steering wheel door handles etc,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fk47574,I was in this position over month ago with my friends and family thinking m crazy for responding before it started to be seen in the news locally ve been trained to work in quarentine situations as medical professional and for disaster preparedness as part of my education and on the job training part of it is was learning from few family members that helped to write FEMA guidelines in California that are still used today concerning disaster preparedness Part of that is knowing how people respond in quarentine situations and what to expect from society as well as how to respond Understanding the psychology behind the responses that are being seen today can help you not become victim Things could go few possible ways at this point We could see large response from the government to impose what you could think of as martial law and will look like what China has done or what Italy is doing Or you will see what the US is doing currently hiding things and making outright false statements to try and stop the panic or to try and save business and limit their losses financially Obviously there can be number of reasons why government will act one way or another but what you are seeing here now in the US is corporate greed over the lives of it citizens What you will probably see is drastic number of infected that may well rival what China is facing because of this greed and the unwillingness for business to close and for the government to care for it citizens oh and the lack of testing There will probably be large number of deaths as is evident already in the last week in the US and things are only getting started This will become worse largely because of the lack of health coverage in this country This is also because of the massive shortage in healthcare professionals and equipment that works as well as limited facilities m expecting that you ll start to see makeshift hospitals like you did during Spanish flu and when the US had massive TB outbreak in the last few hundred years When saw what is happening in China and on the level it was spreading that is when knew it was time to prepare beyond the recommended week supply you should always have on hand While there are far more deadly illnesses out there this one is spreading like wild fire and is sometimes undetected for at least few days in lot of people So we really have no idea how many people are actually sick yet and will see in the next few weeks how bad it really is Oh and have you noticed how many people in public cough whole lot and go out while sick even before Corona Yeah that is also not going to stop right away Now the only thing we can really do is prepare as best we can while not hording Help those around you to be educated with correct information and stop the spread of false info and limit the panic Learn how to make sanitizer masks and basic first aid in the event that you are not able to get to hospital Learn as much as you can and stay alert You don need to panic but you need to go into this with the mind that no one is going to be there to help if things get bad While don think it will be like this at all it is still better to over educate yourself just in case it does happen Don be statistic and help those around you without putting yourself in harm way Make sure to wash everything you bring into your house and it is probably best if you set up decontamination area where you can remove and dispose of soiled items safely before entering the rest of your house It may seem bit overkill but live with someone who is immunocompromised and m not going to be the one who kills them All keys and phones are cleaned when coming home hands are washed and all clothes are removed in the garage to be washed right away if any visits are made to crowded places In some instances ve even washed myself with disinfectant soap before coming inside because someone coughed on me at work while it may not do much if catch something it will help reduce the chances of me spreading it We can overcome this but at this point it not something we should rely on the government for as they have already shown they are not prepared for this as the rest of the world is not prepared recommend reading up on local disaster support as well where to get help if you need it ,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fip4hh3,I have no love for the hard alt right or anything but can understand where they re coming from completely and think that what happening is bit fucked up for them Let me explain Anyone who studies demographics can tell you that the vast majority of the Republican and Tory bases are older types Those older than typically They are overrepresented in the voting public the elderly are much more likely to vote than not Youths tend to be apathetic about politics even though they tend to lean liberal to left The alt right has made solid in roads with youths but not in any overwhelming number so it not quite enough to tip the scales President Trump victory in was by most accounts fluke it could have gone either way The youth vote is depressed and those under tend to vote in far fewer numbers than the crowd Despite this Democrats are still roughly equivalent with Republicans it takes almost catatonic years like where only around of the voting public actually voted in midterms and the vast majority were years old for the GOP to achieve overwhelming success The alt right revolution is really kept alive by the elderly vote Now take look at the demographic most likely to perish in coronavirus pandemic It not like the Spanish Flu which largely targeted the crowd It barely even seems to make dent in children in fact If anything coronavirus seems almost aggressively targeted at those middle aged and older those older than are somewhere around more likely to die And if coronavirus spread further and with deadly vigor we could see tens of millions of deaths in the West by the end of the year alone the majority of which would be the conservative power base Trump narrowly won and that was year where the GOP didn vote in any larger numbers while the Democrats were depressed compared to even If say million Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers were to die the GOP would suffer extreme setbacks nationwide If it million or more which is nightmare scenario regardless of your politics you can basically consider the Republican Party nonviable political entity almost overnight Same deal in the UK Vast majority of Tories and Brexiteers are pensioners and the FPTP voting system rewards this No amount of gerrymandering or winner take all could keep the Tories viable if more than few million die off all at once This is why think there paranoia among the right wing Imagine if coronavirus was repeat of the Spanish Flu and the hardest hit were Millennials and older Zoomers If million died in the States even California would likely go red The GOP would have total control for generation The reverse is possible with coronavirus even Mississippi could go blue Funnily enough ve already started seeing some perhaps just trolls trying to get rise say that President Trump should use the coronavirus as an excuse to declare martial law and forcibly drawn the swamp Whether this situation has occurred to them or not can say But do feel that if the situation deteriorates rapidly the sociopolitical effects thus discussed will definitely come up in discussion ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

with politicians from various political parties during which they discussed the coronavirus and agreed upon certain steps that needed to be taken Shah said that following discussions with all stakeholders it was decided that the only way to control the virus was to curtail its spread There is only one way to curtail its spread as this virus transfers from one person to another very fast so we need to minimise people interaction he said The chief minister said that the spread of the virus should be curtailed and at the same time health facilities should be improved We should not arrive at situation where we have more patients and our health facilities are not sufficient he cautioned The purpose of the lockdown is that all offices and places for gatherings will be closed He said that those who are not required to do step out in public will not be allowed to do so If someone wants to step out they should have valid reason The provincial chief minister said that they will try to make sure food is supplied in shops adding that they were trying to ensure that if someone wanted to step out to buy groceries they would able to do so once in two day period Shah said that the way to monitor this was that anyone who steps out will carry their computerised national identity card CNIC card with them Once that CNIC is entered into the law enforcement system we have the IT facilities to find out in the database if they are going out more than twice The chief minister said that if someone has an emergency such as taking patient to hospital they will be allowed to do so He added that two people could go together along with driver Our recommendation is that more than two people don sit in car he said The chief minister said that ATMs will remain open He said that banks should

up which will share all the details about who will be allowed to step out who won be and who will be allowed to do so in certain situations These notifications will be updated on daily basis as we find out problems he said Additionally team has been formed headed by the chief secretary that will be available hours Shah urged the people of Sindh to support the government decision Country will not be put under lockdown PM Imran Meanwhile Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would not put the country under lockdown and urged citizens to be disciplined and self quarantine themselves Addressing the nation through televised message the prime minister explained that enforcing lockdown would mean curfew and would harm the population of the country living below the poverty line per cent of the population of our country lives under the poverty line Putting the country under lockdown would mean that my daily wage workers street vendors small shop owners would be locked inside their homes How would they earn then He added that if the situation in Pakistan was similar to that in Italy or France he would have imposed lockdown immediately He urged citizens to take themselves towards lockdown and to self quarantine Warning the nation that the coronavirus would spread fast if they were not careful he urged people to be cautious for the sake of the elderly Asking citizens to use their wisdom and intelligence he urged them to be self disciplined and stay at home If you aren careful our entire nation will suffer If you do this we will get out of this difficult time like China has done The premier added that he and his team were constantly focused on bringing the nation out of the coronavirus pandemic and said that he would inform the country about steps the government would take for the industry He also advised citizens to not hoard supplies adding that the country had no shortage of food He asked them to refrain from spreading panic saying that panic is bigger threat than

fktdplj,Uh oh you re not going to like this By William Booth March at m EDT LONDON Immediately after Boris Johnson completed his Monday evening news conference which saw somber prime minister encourage his fellow citizens to avoid all nonessential contact with others his aides hustled reporters into second off camera briefing That session presented jaw dropping numbers from some of Britain top modelers of infectious disease who predicted the deadly course of the coronavirus could quickly kill hundreds of thousands in both the United Kingdom and the United States as surges of sick and dying patients overwhelmed hospitals and critical care units The new forecasts by Neil Ferguson and his colleagues at the Imperial College COVID Response Team were quickly endorsed by Johnson government to design new and more extreme measures to suppress the spread of the virus The report is also influencing planning by the Trump administration Deborah Birx who serves as the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force cited the British analysis at news conference Monday saying her response team was especially focused on the report conclusion that an entire household should self quarantine for days if one of its members is stricken by the virus The Imperial College London group reported that if nothing was done by governments and individuals and the pandemic remained uncontrolled would die in Britain and million in the United States over the course of the outbreak These kinds of numbers are deeply concerning for countries with top drawer health care systems They are terrifying for less developed countries global health experts say If Britain and the United States pursued more ambitious measures to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus to slow but not necessarily stop the epidemic over the coming few months they could reduce mortality by half to people in the United Kingdom and million in the United States People at London Liverpool Street Station during rush hour as the number of coronavirus cases grows around the world Hannah Mckay Reuters Finally if the British government quickly went all out to suppress viral spread aiming to reverse epidemic growth and reduce the case load to low level then the number of dead in the country could drop to below To do this the researchers said Britain would have to enforce social distancing for the entire population isolate all cases demand quarantines of entire households where anyone is sick and close all schools and universities and do this not for weeks but for to months until vaccine is available We might be living in very different world for year or more Ferguson told reporters The modelers did not give numbers for the United States for the most intense suppression efforts The researchers reminded governments that these forecasts are based on current observed trends in China South Korea Britain and Italy but that much remains unknown about the virus The Imperial College report which was shared with the British government over the weekend ahead of its official release Monday was responsible in large part for Johnson turnaround decision to begin rolling out what Downing Street described as life altering drastic measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus aides said Johnson said the virus would overwhelm any health system in the world if quarantines and limits on social contact are not taken Although the measures we have already announced are extreme we may have to go further in the coming days the prime minister said Tuesday Johnson urged his fellow citizens to immediately start to avoid all nonessential contact with others work from home and self isolate now if they are elderly or suffer from underlying medical conditions The measures are still voluntary but Johnson warned that his government had the power to make them mandatory Boris Johnson Many more families are going to lose loved ones to coronavirus British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on March that the most dangerous period of the coronavirus was some weeks away for Britain Reuters Johnson said that healthy and asymptomatic Britons should avoid pubs clubs and theaters In London the bars were still open Monday Most schools museums and restaurants were too But the prime minister said closing schools was under consideration Roy Anderson an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College who was not part of the study said Britain probably had much more to do don know if these measures are enough yet he said And wish we had done them last week If Britain had continued on the go slow step by step course that it set just days ago the Imperial College modeling envisioned hundreds of thousands of deaths and tidal wave of cases that would overwhelm the National Health Service and its hospitals There are currently ventilators available for all of England the largest nation within the United Kingdom with population of million The British forecast also influenced thinking at the White House On Monday evening in Washington President Trump said that Americans should avoid gathering in groups of more than people eating in restaurants or taking nonessential trips his most significant push yet to combat viral outbreak At news conference Monday at the White House Birx said her group has been working with modelers around the globe including in Britain President Trump listens as Deborah Birx White House coronavirus response coordinator announces that the outbreak could last months and that gatherings should be limited to people during White House briefing on March Jabin Botsford The Washington Post So we had new information coming out from model and what had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing small groups not going in public in large groups But the most important thing was if one person in the household became infected the whole household self quarantined for days Because that stops percent of the transmission outside of the household she said To suppress spread in Britain widespread school and university closings might also be necessary though Ferguson worried about its impact on staffing at NHS hospitals where as many as third of nurses have school age children the Guardian newspaper reported In their forecast the modelers envision that strict measures over the coming months will occasionally be loosened but as soon as they are viral spread could come roaring back The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package will need to be maintained until vaccine becomes available potentially months or more given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed the study concludes Intermittent social distancing triggered by trends in disease surveillance may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relatively short time windows but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound the research team said Today coverage from Post correspondents around the world ,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
fkaifqq,Extract Just the other day went out and observed people mingling en masse watched crowd of tourists in the forecourt of what still call Mann Chinese place their hands as they ve always done into the much touched cement handprints of stars watched shoppers crowd around tables and fondle the shiny iPhones and MacBooks on display at the Apple Store at The Grove watched families squeeze in next to other families to admire the outdoor mall dancing fountain The mall wasn exactly hopping but saw only the odd mask didn notice anyone make an obvious effort to stand six feet away from anyone else If social distancing was happening it was too subtle for me The sun was out Rain had yet to fall Life in the time of coronavirus thought didn seem to have changed our habits so much Still as stood just off to the side taking these scenes in felt an intense wave of loss and nostalgia It was only later when was at home on my own that fully began to understood why At first thought was mourning the enforced separation from each other that we were just about to start experiencing Then realized was mourning togetherness already on the way out from long ago age before Amazon before Netflix before Postmates Before giant flat screen home TVs with surround sound before virtual reality We are in the midst of pandemic People suddenly are falling sick They are dying We must practice social distancing now for our own health to protect the health of others and to fight to keep this coronavirus in check But haven we been distancing ourselves from each other more and more for years Isn being apart becoming more and more our norm d started out thinking about how in California we re used to crises making us come together not come apart In the rubble in the ash we re used to crossing our own property lines and comfort zones and reaching out to anyone at all who needs help But then realized that part of what striking in the modern era of our earthquakes and fires and mudslides is the many times when neighbors who were strangers meet each other in extremis when in calamity communities suddenly spring to life and coalesce Because in the modern age in ordinary circumstances lot of us increasingly keep to ourselves After all it become so very easy and convenient Why go to restaurant when you can have exactly what you would have ordered there delivered to you in the comfort of your home Why go to theater when you can watch movie that practically just come out on TV Why go see friend when you can Facetime and text Why go to the store and see people except for pandemic panic shopping when you have Amazon and Instacart Why work in an office with others when you can do your job on your own in your pajamas The day after went out in search of crowds the rain arrived here in Los Angeles literally and figuratively Southern California grew gray and damp Coronavirus closed in Events that draw crowds started being canceled right and left So did plenty of far cozier more intimate gatherings Concerts conferences festivals tournaments classes church services campaign rallies all nixed postponed or preparing to become online only Everything changed in flash dictated by necessity Social distance was no longer theoretical isolation no longer optional ve written before about my worries about modern day world in which more and more people are isolated and lonely working at jobs without offices going whole days without real human contact Now we re all in that boat m hoping enforced separation will do the trick and slow down the community spread of coronavirus m willing to do anything to help make that happen think we all have to be all in to do that Still many things often chose to do immediately felt different and constricting when they were no longer by choice All our modern conveniences our screens and our apps our online shopping our delivery services can provide us with so much coziness and ease when we re feeling overstimulated and worn out and need to retreat from the big world outside But it one thing to work from home because you feel like it and you can It another to be told that you cannot go spend the day with your co workers in the office It one thing to stream movie by choice or to choose to watch basketball game on TV It another to be told that you should not go to movie theater that you can go to basketball game that concerts have been called off It one thing to order in food because you want to put on your comfy clothes and curl up on the couch It another thing to get note from one of the delivery apps saying you can now request not to even see your delivery person but to have your order left at the front door It one thing to know you can choose the big world anytime when you re tired of the couch and of texting Right now of course just few days in want nothing more than to go out to eat with friends to hug neighbor to hold hand m hoping we get to the other side of this without large scale tragedy There no way of knowing yet if we will But if we do m hoping that the experience of social distancing gives us pause and makes us realize how much we have missed company not just the company of those we know and love but of strangers We live in world that can be scary world where people fire into crowds where stock markets crash where the gap between the haves and the have nots keeps growing along with the anger and division But m hoping that if we get through this we don let fear take over that we come together again in full appreciation of how good that can feel Just the other day watched people mingling en masse hope ll get to do so again before long ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

fktc15n,This is an unfair characterization of my community and similar communities Even in the most hasidic communities for example the community where measles spread last year the community itself is not anti vaxx The Rabbis and community leaders along with the local jewish medical professionals work extremely hard to preach science and to tell community members to get vaccinated Many religious Jewish communities actually have high vaccination rates To the point where last year small group of Hasidic anti vaxxers claimed they were being ostracized by their own community when people protested their anti vaxx meetings The reason these viruses spread so quickly in religious Jewish communities is not because people are disregarding science more than any other communities Rather it because the nature of these communities is that there is daily mass contact with other people People attend services times day there are weekly family get togethers on Shabbat Right now there is an Covid outbreak in my community and because some people have been irresponsible as people have been everywhere the community Rabbis have issued closures of all the synagogues and have said that no one over age can leave their homes They issued similar statements year ago urging people to get vaccines The Rabbis also issued closures of the community schools before the state city government did This is important because people take their word as law and abide by it more than they would the law The sentiment in your comment is pretty harmful and only furthers anti semitism ,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

warned policymakers last week that pandemic will last months or longer and could include multiple waves resulting in widespread shortages that would strain consumers and the nation health care system gt gt The page plan dated Friday the same day President Trump declared national emergency laid out grim prognosis for the spread of the virus and outlined response that would activate agencies across the government and potentially employ special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector gt gt Among the additional key federal decisions listed among the options for Mr Trump was invoking the Defense Production Act of Korean War era law that authorizes president to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies such as ventilators respirators and protective gear for health care workers gt gt Shortages of products may occur impacting health care emergency services and other elements of critical infrastructure the plan warned This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics medical supplies including PPE and pharmaceuticals and staffing in some locations P refers to personal protective equipment gt gt The plan continued State and local governments as well as critical infrastructure and communications channels will be stressed and potentially less reliable These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly gt gt The plan which was unclassified but marked For Official Use Only Not For Public Distribution or Release was shared with The New York Times as Mr Trump escalated his efforts to curb the spread of the virus After weeks of playing down the seriousness of the pandemic saying it would miraculously disappear Mr Trump began shifting to more sober tone during news conference on Friday announcing the national emergency gt gt Much of the plan is bureaucratic in nature describing coordination among agencies and actions that in some cases have already been taken like urging schools to close and large events to be canceled But its discussion of the Defense Production Act came as lawmakers and others urged Mr Trump to invoke its powers gt gt While the administration response has so far lacked the urgency this crisis has called for there are still steps you can take to mitigate the damage Senator Bob Menendez Democrat of New Jersey wrote in letter to Mr Trump on Tuesday Invoking the powers vested in the DPA will enable the federal government to step up and take the type of aggressive steps needed in this time of uncertainty gt gt Another letter sent last week by House Democrats led by Representative Andy Levin of Michigan made similar points During World War II our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers tanks and many smaller items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world We know what the demands of this time are and we must act now to meet these demands gt gt Senator Jack Reed Democrat of Rhode Island said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper told him on Tuesday that the Pentagon would provide federal health workers with five million respirator masks and specialized ventilators The American public is on wartime footing in terms of battling the spread of this disease and the Pentagon has to be part of the effort to help protect the health and safety of the American people Mr Reed said gt gt But Mr Trump said on Tuesday that he was not ready to invoke the Defense Production Act We re able to do that if we have to he told reporters Right now we haven had to but it certainly ready If want it we can do it very quickly We ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago actually We ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it We hope we don need it It a big step gt gt Passed in shortly after American troops went to war defending South Korea against an invasion from North Korea the Defense Production Act was based on powers used during World War II and authorized the president to require businesses to prioritize and accept contracts necessary for national defense gt gt Over the years its scope has been expanded to include domestic preparedness and national emergencies president can make direct loans or loan guarantees and purchase commitments subsidies or other incentives to influence industry to help in times of crisis gt gt Other key decisions outlined as options for the president include distributing medical supplies and equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile providing money to

flcufer,A different perspective but Janurary nd guess Around January th noticed the numbers for this illness coming out of Wuhan growing pretty high since the th or so had noticed daily updates of case numbers on local chinese news app through simple push updates that no more than glanced at and got worried While my worries grew over the next few days against what knew would be better cautiousness still met with some friends in Shanghai and even attended tiny recreational gathering on the st The night of the st swore to not engage in outdoors activities needlessly again and on the nd wore respirator while on my way to study at my school campus Shanghai and much of China Asia has strong mask culture from all the pollution or in the case or simple thin masks due to fashion as well The spring term of school was then cancelled throughout China and was given the opportunity to study in New York should wanted to could choose some different classes only available there and also be at physical campus rather than just studying online slept on it then decided sure But was told to leave right away as flights may be grounded within few days Arriving on the st worried about whether would be quarantined or otherwise as arrived from China which would have gladly accepted as precaution instead was simply waived through on landing sense of unreality lingered for moment That should have been the moment knew the S was doomed But compartmentalized it as just lucky Not reconciling that thought with the reality that zero safety measures since knew similar non efforts were being made at airports elsewhere would result in it surely making its way over But instead participated in events while wearing my mask and slowly acclimated to my classes at NYU Two weeks went by Nothing had changed in New York Maybe it would all just pass It simply wouldn make it over here at least seriously Comforted by these thoughts stopped wearing my mask as people became aggresive to me on the trains and elsewhere for wearing my mask Then cases started popping up and still for weeks saw not even poor response but NEGATIVE one from authorities seemingly trying to encourage the spread of the virus Dont wear masks etc misinformation March th on my way to class only saw others wearing respirators and masks out of hundreds of people These people have no idea what is going to hit them was bewildered Not even most of the Chinese International students saw near campus were wearing anything never could have imagined such weakness It a shame there is no forethought and capacity not only in this administration but in American and maybe western society in general Anyone could have done the math and many did if you look around on some forums and places but by and large m sure most two bit politicians and the general swaths of people in America weren even aware of the shortage of ventilators that would cause unimaginable fatalities Hopefully something positive will come of this and not just another Patriot Act but m not holding my breath Originally praying that my suitemates wouldn infect me from their cavalierness eventually found myself flying back to Shanghai And after testing negative on landing regarding the Coronavirus then entered mandatory day quarantine at home Yes quarantine despite testing negative since postives are sent to hospitals directly and days is long enough to starve out false negatives Efficient and what needed against such new era pandemic The strength of strong regimes show in their ability to get things done be it build metro system anywhere it wants and right away or enact any other sort of sweeping laws with ease Brute strength is not something ideologically applauded usually in western thought but it turns out it much more effective than any measures needing to wait for hesistant deliberation Even if this wasn Singapore witnessed more than ever before what benevelent actions from dictatorship could accomplish left Shanghai when it had some cases it now has just under and only dead There was no strain on ventilator capacity due to efficient measures that while not as fast as they could have been helped limit resource overwhelming to Wuhan and Hubei and eventually helped stabilize those areas as well Contrast that with America There a lesson for me ,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

fkdymrq,Well it not that much about preventing you from catching it Masks if used in huge numbers meaning population wise have proven to slow down the progress of epidemics research has been done one this it doesn stop it you still get to the point in total numbers where you would be without masks BUT it slower so hospitals and other organisations are not so overloaded at one point but the sick are spread over time period Just an interesting note face mask doesn completely stop spread either if you sneeze the particles just don go straight but escape the mask from sides so anyone standing on sides or behind you can catch it from you even if you have mask doctors have special training to learn to sneeze at patients during surgeries and not to turn their heads it funny and freaking difficult to resist the urge not to cough at someone xD You also get sick through your eyes which masks don cover You also get sick through inhaling the virus sneeze particles with virus which gets through the mask if you wear it There are respirators with special filters which work better but their are currently in high demand To ask pulbic not to go for masks is not bad decision because you can see it in China if public goes for masks you won have enough masks for doctors policemen firefighters army pharmacists and these people need the protection the most in the first place after you manage to take care of the needs of people likes this then you can start thinking about general public So yeah it can help it not going to cause miracle and it helps probably in different way than you thought at least as understood your text Let hope for the best because governments over the world have different approaches and some are uhmm pretty special so say the least ,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

fj3p8p2,Marcus Fahn Then at some point after long wait the moment came when it was said that now really nothing can be proven and you can go home Can you still remember that amp B Patient remember it very well That was on Friday evening after the criteria for discharge were finally recorded in writing As said we were all fine was there for days Other colleagues already had no more symptoms They had also completely rid themselves of the virus but had to stay there because the criteria for their dismissal had not yet been laid down And we ve been waiting long time for this And that also caused very high psychological pressure on us because we never had perspective And that was just what was missing We were healthy we were more or less trapped in this institution and we had to wait until the ministry decided to write criteria for our release amp B Marcus Fahn Could you understand at that time that it takes so long that one is simply careful amp B Patient Not at all Careful no question but that you take so much time It is not question of duration now You just took your time One decided to finish on Friday evening and discuss it again on Monday evening And there was no consideration for us So they said There are just handful of patients they are in Schwabing they are isolated no problem they can stay in there for few more days or even weeks It just the psychological pressure that has caused us the most trouble amp B Marcus Fahn What was the first thing you did when you were at home amp B Patient ordered pizza welcomed my family hugged them did laundry Of course couldn do laundry for three weeks And then think just sat down on the couch amp B Marcus Fahn So you are back home again You are healthy but you are not yet working at the company headquarters where you would normally work Why amp B Patient don work in the head office yet because don yet fulfill all the requirements of the health authority one hundred percent As said they are very very careful with the whole thing although have already been told by the doctors that am completely healthy and that cannot infect other people by coughing anymore So should stay at home until the last piece of DNA of this virus is out of my body amp B Marcus Fahn That means that you are still being tested regularly at the moment amp B Patient That right m still being tested regularly until it is really proven that even the last spark of this virus is gone But this does not mean that the corona virus is still active in any way They are now looking at the DNA But that a dead DNA so to speak Marcus Fahn There was lot of excitement in the environment of the sick people at Webasto keyword kindergartens schools certainly also in the company itself How did you feel about that Patient There was complete uncertainty again It is known that have the virus and that my daughter goes to the nursery What have to say is that my daughter caregivers e the daily caregivers handled it very professionally They were never afraid of it They are used to it when children have cold or cough They didn treat them any differently now She was always healthy She tested negative even twice So she was perfectly healthy But you could still tell from other parents that they were hysterical The parents council of this daycare center also sent the police to the health department because they thought that the health department should have closed the daycare center amp B Marcus Fahn Let assume that you were not infected but someone else in your environment or in the environment of your child Wouldn you perhaps have had such fears or at least understood them amp B Patient Well you have to distinguish between fear and concern Well would have been worried if had heard that But would have been more worried for the person who has it But if know that any person has been tested negative and if then learn that the course of the disease is really not as the media report it then would of course calm down again amp B Marcus Fahn Now we have to assume that more people will be infected in the near future What would you tell or advise them now amp B Patient First of all would advise everyone to stay calm It is of course new virus that is well known But it is not as bad as the flu So this is really kind of cold The bad thing is you can detect the virus and then you are stamped You just have to accept that If you don have any pre existing conditions it never gonna be bad But if you have pre existing condition and you get the flu for example then it will be much much more serious That why would advise everyone to take care of it first if you have it stay calm If you don have it you should get vaccinated against the flu amp B Marcus Fahn When do you think that your private life will return to complete everyday life amp B Patient For me everyday life is already there amp B Marcus Fahn Well but you are still at home amp B Patient am at home but am allowed to go out normally m just not allowed to go to work amp B Marcus Fahn How do people in your environment friends acquaintances who know that was the one with the coronavirus how do they treat you since you are out amp B Patient They treat me quite normally because am very open and honest with these people They know very well that was never really seriously ill And they also know exactly that am no longer contagious Everything was tested on me ve also been to lung specialist He took another look There nothing to see amp B Marcus Fahn And you would probably wish the same for all the other people in Germany who are now infected with it in the next few days and weeks and then hopefully and this is how it looks after mostly mild course will at some point be back to normal at home or at work amp B Patient Yes that is correct amp B Marcus Fahn Thank you very much for telling us your story and your view wish you and your family all the best and also the people in your environment that everything will calm down and the last rest of the daily routine will return to you amp B Patient Thank you ,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

flar391,Toner said that while it not universally the case that pandemic diseases tend to spread first in the places most open to international travel as general rule that is the progression they follow The virus travels with people Toner said So where people travel is where the virus goes first and then it spreads out from those areas in which it has been introduced By contrast with only few exceptions the states with the fewest number of confirmed cases are smaller Republican leaning ones between the coasts with fewer ties to diverse populations and the global economy That list includes Wyoming Idaho Missouri Montana South Dakota Oklahoma and Kansas One important caveat Testing in the United States remains deficient so many cases are inevitably flying under the radar It not the case that other places don have cases Toner said They just don recognize them yet Republican leaning states to this point are displaying notably less urgency about the outbreak Of the states that have taken the fewest actions to restrict public gatherings or limit restaurant service on statewide basis such as Texas Missouri and Alabama almost all have Republican governors according to research by Topher Spiro the vice president for health policy at the liberal Center for American Progress where he directs program that examines state health initiatives That left Democratic run cities in those red states such as Houston Tucson Nashville and Atlanta to try to impose their own rules on public gatherings Yet all those local limits face an obvious problem People from elsewhere in the state can still travel to their jurisdictions We can seal our borders acknowledged Lina Hidalgo the chief administrator in Harris County Texas which includes Houston when she announced county wide closures on Monday The willingness to impose statewide rules hasn entirely followed party lines Before his announcement in California on Thursday for example Newsom had couched proposals to shut restaurants schools and other establishments as recommendations not requirements thus permitting patchwork of local responses But generally Spiro research found almost all of the states that took the earliest and most dramatic statewide action such as New York New Jersey Connecticut Rhode Island and Illinois have Democratic governors Public attitudes about the outbreak are separating along the same lines The huge differences between Republicans and Democrats extend not only to assessments of Trump response to the outbreak but also to its underlying level of danger and the need to change personal behavior If anything there considerable evidence that those gaps are widening national Gallup poll released Monday for instance found that while percent of Democrats and percent of independents said they feared that they or someone in their family might be exposed to the coronavirus only percent of Republicans agreed That percentage point difference dwarfed the gap in February when slightly more Republicans percent than Democrats percent said they were concerned Other surveys have found comparably stunning differences In an NBC Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday Republicans were only half as likely as Democrats to say that they planned to stop attending large gatherings and just one third as likely to say that they had cut back on eating at restaurants In an NPR PBS NewsHour Marist poll released Tuesday just over half of Republicans said the threat from the virus had been exaggerated compared with one in five Democrats and two in five independents Read This is how Trump will be remembered In nationwide Kaiser Family Foundation poll released the same day about half of Democrats and Democrat leaning independents said the outbreak had disrupted their life at least some according to detailed results provided to me by the pollsters But only one third of Republicans and those who leaned Republican agreed About half of Democrats said they had changed travel plans and decided not to attend large gatherings In both cases less than one third of Republicans agreed Kabaservice says the tendency of GOP voters and officials to downplay the risk partly reflects Trump initially dismissive messaging about the crisis But it may also relate to deeper ideological suspicion of scientists the media and subject matter experts within the federal government This is something we ve gone through while here among Republicans Kabaservice says The feeling increasingly is that experts and the media are all part of this elite class that is self dealing and is looking down on less educated and less fortunate people and that they can be trusted to tell the truth He adds That dynamic has been reinforced by the emergence of the conservative media ecosystem which unstintingly presents elites as threat to viewers The parties contrasting geographic bases of support may also have an influence Recent public polling has found an imposing gulf in attitudes between urban and suburban areas on one side and small town and rural areas on the other In the Gallup survey two thirds of urban residents and three fifths of those in suburbs said they were concerned about someone around them contracting the coronavirus while only about half of those living in rural areas agreed according to detailed results provided to me by Gallup That town and country gap had widened since February In the Kaiser poll more than two thirds of rural residents said the outbreak had disrupted their life little or not at all while nearly half of urban residents said they had already experienced disruption Additionally rural residents were almost twice as likely as those in urban areas to express confidence in Trump handling of the crisis Eva Kassens Noor professor in the global urban studies program at Michigan State University studied urban rural patterns in the flu pandemic in India Her research found that mortality was much greater in urban places above certain density level than in rural places below it She believes that S communities will experience the coronavirus in contrasting but complex ways While the disease will probably spread more rapidly in urban areas she says more of the population there is young and healthy And while outbreaks may not be as pervasive in rural America they could still prove very damaging because the population is older and has less access to quality health care Mortality rates she says will ultimately hinge on how rigorously communities minimize interaction by practicing social distancing It is all about individuals closing all of their social networking she says More penetration of the virus into reliably Republican rural regions probably won erase the partisan gap in perception of the danger The Republican pollster Bill McInturff whose firm Public Opinion Strategies co manages the NBC WSJ poll says that even Republicans in and around big cities remain much more dubious of the threat than their Democratic neighbors But if the outbreak becomes more widely dispersed over time it may be tougher for even the most conservative governors to resist action or for Trump to escape consequences for his initially dismissive response Seattle San Francisco New York Boston are just few weeks ahead of other parts of the country Toner said There will be outbreaks in places that we will be very surprised by am quite confident about that ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

fktb1j3, gt general election during Covid outbreak disadvantages pore opposition even more gt On March the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee EBRC report was released gt This means that the General Election will likely be called soon Real soon gt Election in the time of Covid gt The release of the report comes amidst flurry of developments on the Covid front gt With an increasing number of confirmed cases the government has announced slew of enhanced precautionary measures from Stay Home Notices travel restrictions and advisories gt Just days before the EBRC report was out Gan Kim Yong the minister for health and co chair of the multi ministry task force on Covid announced that all ticketed events with or more participants are to be cancelled or deferred gt Owners of dining venues were also advised to reduce close contact between patrons gt With such social distancing measures it may seem counterintuitive to hold the election anytime soon since the process of political campaigning and polling typically involves interaction with large groups of people gt In response to the release of the EBRC report opposition parties have also put out statements urging the government to focus on the battle against Covid gt The Progress Singapore Party also told Mothership that it hopes Singapore can focus on the containment of Covid for now gt Citing the lack of urgency for an election given the current parliamentary term ends in April the Singapore Democratic Party SDP also called on the government to categorically rule out the GE until it is clear we are seeing the tail end of the virus spread gt The SDP added that this would show that the PAP is putting its own interests over the people safety gt The Workers Party WP the only opposition party with parliament seats urged the government to take caution and exercise judiciousness in calling for GE gt In its statement on March WP said that the government decision must be one that is in the the best interests of Singapore our democracy and the public health of Singaporeans gt The PAP seeking fresh mandate gt But there may be good reason for the PAP to call for GE sooner than later gt Firstly it could be way for the PAP to secure strong mandate to tackle the Covid crisis gt PM Lee hinted at this on March saying that the election date will depend on what will best see Singapore through the Covid crisis gt He said that Singapore has two choices gt Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances but we have no certainty of that Or else call elections early knowing that we are going into hurricane to elect new government with fresh mandate and full term ahead of it which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand gt Opposition disadvantaged on several fronts gt Some analysts that Today spoke to however have explained how calling for the GE now will disadvantage the opposition gt We are in heading into crises times gt Historically the ruling party tends to see landslide victories in times of great global uncertainty and crises gt For instance the General Election which took place months after the September attacks saw the PAP winning with overwhelming per cent vote share gt Incidentally was also the first election held in Singapore after the Asian Financial Crisis of gt Currently Singapore and the world is facing health pandemic on global scale and the threat of financial recession looms gt The virus crisis is likely to be political boon for the ruling party as Singapore heads into deeply uncertain future understandably voters do not want to rock the boat during such times gt The ruling party is further advantaged by its management of Covid which has earned praise from even the World Health Organisation for our containment efforts gt Infectious disease specialist Dale Fisher who has also been involved with the World Health Organisation Global Outbreak Alert amp Response Network GOARN for years also said gt Overall internationally don believe the world is ready for this outbreak But Singapore is gt Privileges those with great resources gt Secondly Covid will inadvertently affect how rallies are run gt And this is likely to advantage parties with greater resources gt For instance analysts that spoke to Today suggested that event organisers would have to implement temperature screening measures book multiple venues to ensure adequate segregation of participants and also consider live streaming debates on social media gt This would likely result in huge logistical costs which disadvantages opposition parties with fewer resources gt Nature of opposition rallies gt Going digital also fundamentally alters the way politicians interact with electors and hence alters the entire campaigning experience in way that may disadvantage the opposition gt Opposition party rallies have historically seen much larger crowds than those organised by the PAP gt But what does crowd size really mean gt There the argument that more people at opposition party rallies means more votes for them gt But crowds may not necessarily reflect voter sentiment either gt Nevertheless rallies are still crucial mode in which the opposition canvases for votes from swing voters gt These undecided voters are more likely to attend rallies and spend more time reading up on party campaigns before polling gt And needless to say physically standing in crowd and listening to powerful speeches during rally is vastly different from watching video uploaded to your Facebook feed gt Yes this disadvantages the opposition But this isn new gt Terence Lee said in commentary published by CNA that Covid is the elephant in the room that may be the ultimate game changer gt But even without this external crisis facing us the attainment of the PAP effective political dominance in Singapore means that the opposition in Singapore has been historically disadvantaged gt In Is the PAP here to stay Associate Professor Bilveer Singh elaborated on how performance legitimacy of the PAP coupled with entrenchment of its power has made it difficult for the opposition to replace this ruling party gt Since the PAP has attained parliamentary dominance since they have successfully met various challenges to secure economic and social stability gt They have since then also secured control over political and non political organisations in Singapore gt The party has also engineered the rules of engagement seen in the case of gerrymandering where electoral boundaries are carved out by the ruling party to better their chances of increasing vote share gt Lee pointed out that the three SMCs Sengkang West Punggol East and Fengshan that have disappeared in this year EBRC report have been strong stomping ground for WP candidates since gt We see the effects of politics in everyday life as well in something as banal but important nevertheless as lift upgrading gt Workers Party former NCMP Yee Jenn Jong had argued that the PAP has been subtly and sometimes openly crafting the narrative that support for the opposition would adversely affect Singapore well being and stability gt In university student asked PM Lee why opposition wards are not treated as well as PAP wards namely PAP wards being prioritised when it comes to resource allocation and upgrading programmes gt PM Lee said gt There has to be distinction Because the PAP wards supported the government and the policies which delivered these good things Between the people who voted and supported the programme and the government and the people who didn I think if we went and put yours before the PAP constituencies it would be an injustice gt Difficulties will always lay ahead gt The opposition acknowledges that while these are very real challenges the truth is many key opposition parties aren interested in replacing the PAP as the ruling party yet gt Parties like the Workers Party for instance are more focused on challenging the ruling party by winning more parliamentary seats and having greater voice in Parliament gt Their manifesto wrote gt Parliament monopolised by one party fails the test of rigorous debate and voting in forging sound policies Parliament that includes MPs from rational responsible and respectable opposition party compels the government to listen to the collective wisdom of the people gt There will always be difficulties that lay ahead for Singapore opposition gt It always had since gt But the possibility of emerging victorious arguably against rather stacked odds to create better future for Singapore will continue to propel many to diligently work towards their political goals gt Top photo by Mothership sg Source

fkpyypp,Can someone kindly create thread of its own as am new here Camostat is per tablet potential Corona killer as previously published in highly reputed sites such as Cell Nature and Forbes clinical study is finally about to begin If the world get more attention we can kick slow Japanese me included to expedite Nikkei Business https business nikkei com atcl gen Effective for new corona Unexpected pharmaceuticals in Japan with high expectations March The spread of the new coronavirus infection does not stop Vaccines and therapeutics are also being developed around the world but it is necessary to confirm safety and efficacy in clinical trials through animal experiments and it will take years to commercialize including the development of mass production systems right What if drugs that have already been approved and widely used can be used as they are Validation of efficacy and safety can be done more quickly increasing the likelihood of getting to market faster From such viewpoint expectations for certain pharmaceutical products in Japan are increasing The drug is camostat mesylate which is used to treat chronic pancreatitis drug that inhibits the action of proteolytic enzymes created by Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and launched in under the name of Huoipan Tablets Substance patents have already expired and number of generic manufacturers in the country are selling drugs with the same ingredients Earlier in March German researchers reported in the renowned scientific journal Cell that the drug could block the transmission of the new coronavirus and has received attention Researchers say that when the new coronavirus infects human cells it binds to receptor protein called ACE on the cell membrane and then TMPRSS type of enzyme called serine protease also on the cell membrane Was used to find out that it had entered the cell Camostat is known to block TMPRSS and has never been tested at the laboratory level to prevent coronavirus infection which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS Has also been reported In this paper researchers have confirmed in experiments using cultured cells that camostat can prevent infection of cells with both the new coronavirus and the SARS virus According to the paper however it is necessary to administer significantly higher doses than are currently prescribed for medicines to prevent infection However in another research group reported in mouse experiment with animals that camostat prevents SARS virus infection At this time the mice received milligrams per kilogram of body weight twice daily There is calculation formula that converts the amount of effect in mice to humans and when applied to humans it is calculated to be effective in two doses of about milligrams day Camostat is given mg three times day for chronic pancreatitis In other words the same amount that has been used for chronic pancreatitis for many years may be effective against the new coronavirus Camostat has been approved only in Japan and South Korea so development in other countries will probably need to be done through animal experiments Even in Japan it is not drug approved for pneumonia so it is necessary to conduct clinical studies on patients with severe pneumonia and verify its safety and efficacy in the future Nevertheless the fastest way to commercialize it is to conduct clinical research in Japan using drugs used in Japan and verify its effectiveness Ono commented on this paper saying We did not actively consider it because the results in this paper were significantly higher than those used in clinical practice We will respond but there is no request at the moment Some academia has expressed expectations Naoto Uemura Director of Clinical Pharmacology Center Oita University Hospital said It is necessary to carefully consider how much effect can be obtained but if it is effective by diverting existing drugs early commercialization is expected can do it Another national university seems to be planning clinical research drug that has already been approved and distributed in Japan and is expected to be effective against pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus is Kaletra an anti AIDS virus HIV drug from AbbVie USA generic name lopinavir ritonavir There is also Orbesco ciclesonide treatment for bronchial asthma sold by Teijin Pharma Ciclesonide reports that prefectural hospital in Kanagawa Prefecture administered to three patients with pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus and all three patients improved Teijin Pharma Limited announced on March that it will secure of the drug and supply it to clinical research etc at the request of the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare The anti influenza drug Avigan favipiravir is also expected to be effective against the new coronavirus but the approval of Avigan is for stockpiling and has not been widely used in clinical practice Either way we hope to find way to counter the new coronavirus more quickly by converting existing drugs ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

conference on the Wuhan coronavirus Channel NewsAsia Jan th gt gt gt At press conference about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak on Monday th January Minister Chan Chun Sing who is also the deputy chairman of the People Association stated that one of the roles of the PA was to push out regular information to combat rumours and fake news about the virus gt Trying to contain rumours that are already making the rounds is essentially responsive in nature But Minister Chan comments acknowledge that there is value in being proactive and forthcoming from the start gt This is quite different tune from the one he was singing couple of weeks ago when he met MP Pritam Singh questions about Singapore workforce with the now infamous What is the point of the question gt gt gt gt When it comes to releasing data the government attitude has generally been that less is more gt few recent examples when POFMA was being debated in Parliament last year Minister Shanmugam rejected MP Louis Ng and NMP Irene Quay calls for Freedom of Information Act His reasons Civil servants would be inundated with odd requests and such an Act would mainly benefit lawyers businessmen and journalists never mind that it our job to ask questions gt And on January th in speech at the Institute of Policy Studies IPS conference Minister Chan yes him again audaciously declared that sharing data will not be panacea to policy issues gt He then followed up with this gem gt If people don trust you you can give as much data as you want and you will not win over the hearts or the minds of the people gt m sorry but this is absolutely bonkers gt Saying that people trust is prerequisite for releasing information is completely backwards Being forthcoming with information is what creates trust It is the ultimate gesture of transparency from government which understands that vice grip on information doesn guarantee control It only gives the impression of having something to hide gt public health crisis like the Wuhan virus outbreak shows how an open communicative government is critical to maintaining public confidence When authorities insist on withholding information they effectively cede control of the narrative And in the absence of clear direction people will automatically assume the worst gt When the virus was first detected in Wuhan public health officials claimed that the illness posed little danger According to the Guardian the official line from China national health commission was that the situation was controllable gt Before you could so much as sneeze hundreds of people were sick Wuhan went into lockdown People started speculating that millions had fled the city ahead of time though nobody knew for sure or if it was just Chinese New Year travel Whistleblower videos began circulating on Weibo and WhatsApp purportedly showing bodies lying on gurneys in Chinese hospitals and nurses claiming the body count was being wildly under declared gt It possible that some of the rumours were trolls at work It also possible that some of them stemmed from ordinary people badly spooked who had resorted to filling information gaps with guesswork gt gt gt gt gt To give the Singapore government credit it has done good job so far in keeping the public informed about the outbreak gt The Ministry of Health MOH has been providing regular updates about suspected and or confirmed cases including contact tracing News about travel restrictions quarantine sites mandatory leaves of absence for returning travellers and enhanced screening and checks appears daily Ministers have taken pains to appear on the ground and reassure the public that robust measures are in place to manage the situation gt All this goes to show that being forthright goes long way towards maintaining people trust gt This point stands whether or not there is an ongoing crisis An emergency like the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak makes the need for transparency more obvious but how an organisation responds in an emergency is only as good as its practices on an average day gt If leaders are already cagey and defensive in the best of times or don trust their people to act sensibly this probably won change during the worst gt gt gt gt gt Most recently Health Minister Gan Kim Yong invoked POFMA against Hardwarezone forum post which falsely claimed that an elderly Singaporean man had died of the Wuhan coronavirus gt The post was made at PM on Sunday January th What followed was swift and painless the POFMA office issued Correction Notice that night and SPH Magazines complied by Monday morning The post was taken down and correction posted in its stead gt This was the sixth time POFMA was invoked since it came into force late last year We can argue over whether the first five cases were ham fisted bids to stifle political dissent or good faith attempts to combat disinformation gt In this case it was clear that MOH had good cause to act without delay Exploiting people fears to stir panic in crisis is utterly reprehensible gt But further point to be drawn from all this is that resistance to releasing information creates the perfect kind of breeding ground for rumours conspiracy theories and yes fake news that POFMA was meant to combat gt Tackling fake news becomes even more challenging when there is fundamental imbalance in access to information Disinformation spread by malicious actors is one thing but speculation born of ignorance is another gt As NMP Walter Theseira pointed out during the Second Reading of POFMA in Parliament differences in opinion are bound to arise when the public only has partial information If only the government has the full picture then it shouldn be affronted when people try to fill the holes with guesswork gt Of course some people will approach data with confirmation bias as Minister Chan raised in rebuttal at the IPS conference Of course others will use it to prod the government with uncomfortable questions gt But the former blind spots will speak for themselves and the latter is what engaged citizens are supposed to do You can cherry pick when it comes to active citizenship If our politicians want Singaporeans to be clear eyed digitally literate and actively invested in this country future then they need to give us the information we need to know what we re doing gt The reality of our world now is that social media will always be flooded with fake news Even the most liberal use of POFMA god forbid would be like holding up Band Aid to tidal wave gt And if as m sure the government would agree we all have an interest in distinguishing fact from fiction then it should be more upfront in giving us the data to tell the difference gt gt If you re wondering what the point of this op

ffyhmzq,I a virologist am actually pretty tired of going through this with people over and over so appreciate the mega thread dispelling some of the rumors running around Pubmed is an amazing resource for epidemiology on this and will track things better than what you see in press releases since most press releases get their info from pubmed gt Wuhan coronavirus AKA nCoV is coronavirus as many have guessed it is frustrating for the news to just call it coronavirus though as there are hundreds of strains out there ranging from the common cold in people to SARS and MERS while Coronaviruses in people tend to be transmitted via respiratory routs they also are known to pass through the gastrointestinal system in people and animals especially cattle It just depends on the strain Being airborne is scary but as the post says many other diseases are as well gt masks only masks rated for small particle protection aka viral protection will actually do anything Many surgical masks don do this type masks will however work That said all masks have an effective use time and their lives can be quite short Surgical masks are only protective for min before they are over saturated with the moisture from your breath and again many do not protect against viruses believe s are good for an hour before they need to be changed But better than wearing mask cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough to protect others by putting your nose in to your shoulder and wash your hands often hand sanitizer works but washing hands with warm water and soap is better Don be gross gt Some patients particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions develop severe form of pneumonia SARS and MERS both did something similar though MERS was shutting down other organs in people with preexisting conditions like diabetes gt There no vaccine yet This is my field though don work on corona viruses make vaccines for Influenza and few other diseases for living No vaccine will be commercially viable for some time anyone who says or hopes for soon as in weeks or months is being dishonest with the time frame to make something commercially viable China also has pretty spotty record with making vaccines at least in agricultural vaccines ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

crusade to push the party economic agenda further to the left gt gt The candidate wants to dramatically expand government in order to address the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country as he put it Wednesday gt gt Mr Sanders uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign It energizes his core supporters who favor his purity over more flexible rivals But it has also turned off Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give and take necessary to accomplish change in Washington As Mr Sanders himself has acknowledged many also worry that his far left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in general election The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk averse when choosing leader gt gt Mr Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform even if they are skeptical of his candidacy Poll after poll shows that strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda he said in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front runner Joe Biden despite two straight weeks of big primary losses and mounting calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr Trump gt gt He vowed to use this Sunday debate the first solely between the two candidates to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona Florida Illinois and Ohio gt gt Mr Sanders bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle pitting him against affluent party donors and longtime policy makers who share many of his general goals but prefer less government oriented or more tempered approach gt gt Surveys indicate party electorate torn February Wall Street Journal NBC News poll showed of Democratic voters preferred candidate pushing Sanders like larger scale policies that might cost more and bring major change versus favoring Biden like candidate who proposes smaller scale policies that will bring less change gt gt But the same poll found Democrats by to favored candidate with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump over one closest to your views and they have increasingly concluded Mr Biden has the best chance gt gt When Mr Sanders self proclaimed democratic socialist appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest his sweeping platform of national health care universal free college and Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts gt gt Harvard economist Lawrence Summers top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama predicted major adverse consequences for workers markets and business investment should Mr Sanders prevail Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman also now at Harvard said the Sanders program would lead to too many individuals too constrained from choices and weaker economy The Progressive Policy Institute Washington center left think tank branded the Sanders platform fiscal fantasy gt gt None of that moved Mr Sanders to soften his policies Instead Mr Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks as much as Republicans for long term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans despite the long expansion gt gt We need to think outside the box said Warren Gunnels Mr Sanders longtime policy adviser Over the past years we ve seen massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle It too late for establishment economics gt gt Mr Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering moral economy than strategies to boost gross domestic product business investment or corporate profits With his economic bill of rights he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans job health insurance college and housing gt gt Many Democratic economists would argue those are fine aspirations but in order to achieve them you have to intervene in markets beyond levels they re comfortable with said Jared Bernstein senior fellow at the left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then Vice President Biden gt gt Mr Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes bigger government spending and more regulation He would boost the size of the federal government share of GDP to level exceeded only once during World War II gt gt While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces Mr Sanders has less trust in the power of markets to improve lives On Thursday he said his big government vision of national health care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic gt gt At times he has dismissed cost concerns outright Asked at Feb CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels he replied You tell me how much is too much if we re talking about saving this planet gt gt Mr Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven been seriously considered since the gt gt The candidate already claims victory on that front recounting how proposals from his failed bid dismissed at the time as too far left have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders gt gt One fight with Hillary Clinton who won the Democratic nomination was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to an hour The Democratic led House last year passed bill seeking to make that law while all his rival candidates endorsed the goal Mr Sanders proposal for Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the field Mr Biden current positions on many issues such as expanding the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs have moved him closer to Mr Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career gt gt have been called radical and extreme Mr Sanders said during an Iowa campaign stop last year Over the last four years whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme gt gt Even some mainstream center left economists praise Mr Sanders bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending All upper income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the S and do fine said Adam Posen president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations We ve gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be Mr Posen said gt gt The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents Economists who weren part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign One is Stephanie Kelton professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook Y who served as an aide to Mr Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee She is the leading proponent of modern monetary theory which argues that governments shouldn fret over debt and deficits gt gt Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University whose work focuses on what he calls economic justice

fk0238h,I wanted to write up on how my everyday life has changed in the last couple of months living in Korea It long but felt wanted to share it with anyone who interested How we are dealing with CORVID It been almost months since most of my kids classes has stopped altogether Some earlier than others but for month now everything been cancelled School and kindergarten should ve started on Mar nd We ve been told they ll start on the rd but one it possible they ll postpone the date again and two we don know how we feel about sending the kids to school even if they actually do open We re starting to worry about how this will affect the older boy school work and education and we try to give him some sort of homework for him to do at least enough to keep him from forgetting stuff he learned in st grade We had teacher come and teach him math etc for about minutes every week and give daily worksheet to do fairly common in Korea That on class is being held through tablet app with video chat Pretty cool actually Both kids are reading lot of books mostly because they get bored of playing all day get to read book after book after book for the little one which kind of like They can meet their friends which is pretty sad and we are thankful that they have each other company hear my colleagues with single child having much harder time trying to entertain their kids My wife is SAHM and she been spending time with the two kids They go out for walk about once week if the weather nice all with their mask on It actually not that bad since there are few people on the street and nearby trails other than dog owners walking their dogs They get to take the mask off and breath in some fresh air which is probably due to China stopped lot of their factories leading to cleaner air in Korea The boys and have learned to enjoy each other company since it is their only option They get along much better and that some burden off of my wife shoulders We don go out to malls or anywhere indoor at all We used to be able to online order fresh food before midnight and they be on our front door at am the next day but now they re often sold out We have succeeded in ordering some stuff when we order early in the afternoon or so We take turns going to the grocery alone again with our mask try to let her go as often as can so she can get at least little time by herself even if it for short drive to and from the store We find ourselves buying less of fresh veggies and parishables because we don want to goto the store often We end up buying more frozen food than we like She come up with so many creative ways to pass the time with the kids often transforming normal house chores into some kind of game but we both agree options are running out She very tired all the time and we re just waiting for all this to pass lot of companies in Korea have decided to have their employees work from home That is not the case where work but it could change in an instant if any one of our employees turn up to be confirmed of the virus For now masks are mandatory Riding the company bus taking the elevator walking through halls etc all require masks We have big sign in the elevator that reads NO MASK NO ELEVATOR Koreans already tend to wear mask often when they have cold or something but now you get weird looks if you re not wearing one within the company Sanitizers are everywhere and we ve gotten acustomed to just sanitizing our hands whenever we see one without giving it second thought ve probably used it around times today In addition when we goto the cafetaria there are employees with sanitizers in both hands spraying every single employees before we get in few days ago we had plastic transparent wall installed on our cafetaria table for every spot so people eating facing each other are blocked from any unecessary droplet infection Most social and non essential meetings have been either cancelled delayed or are held over phones We get several text messages from the goverment regarding CORVID It used to be used for national emergencies such as earthquake warnings heat warnings etc But nowadays they re all about the virus If confirmed case in my city is found the city immediately messages everyone do mean everyone in the city think it a feature in all Korean phones and cannot be opted out the patient age gender location down to which section of the city and where they ve gone in the last few days or so It gets down to specific restaurant name We also get general reminders for washing hands wearing masks and not attending religious social meetings Starting today th of March we received messages on how to go about purchasing masks Masks have been huge part of our lives for the last month or so We take them off at home in our own cars and in my cubicle while working but do keep them Butabout half the time even in my cubicle just in case We hear KF KF probably Korean mask filter ability standard not sure what the global standards are are preferable but do have couple hundreds of the cheap disposable ones that bought few weeks before the virus broke out the ones that surgeons use so just use those and dispose of them after day of use My main concern is my habit of touching my face inadvertantly and people coughing sneezing close to me All the mask you can buy online are either sold out or have gone up crazy in price Ones we used to be able to get for less than USD costs Because of this Korean government decided to limit Korean mask manufacturers on how much they can export compared to domestic sales think it was more than but not sure and the government is buying most of the mask themselves to sell to the people for reasonable price Basically it martial law for mask sales They tried few methods which had loopholes obviously and seem to have decided on the current method masks per person week They are sold ONLY at the pharmacy because they already have system to make sure people aren perscribed medication repeatedly Simply put they punch in your national ID number and they can see if you ve bought your ration of your masks for the week You also have to be there in person unless you re buying masks for kids years or younger or or older person that you live with Even then it has to be your day For example was born in This means my day is Tuesday can buy two on Tuesday only My son was born can bring an official document that proves that we live together Then can buy including for my son My wife can buy on another day of the week Monday because she was born in and my younger son was born in on Monday on Tuesday etc will be stopping by my local pharmacy to pick up masks for the kids tomorrow This is the first week of the policy and m sure there will be confusion everywhere but think it a reasonable plan personally don think the masks already have are inadequate but you don know how long this CORVID will last so d like to buy them while can All in all our life has gotten much more

fgs5mra,So read an article last week that talks about Chinese viralologist sp ve spelt that many words wrong my keyboard can autocorrect m probably autistic who got lot of money from both Chinese and American governments So the new corona strain is documented and how it come into existence the missing research papers probably fill in the gaps from that article on when the bioengineering of this new strain of corona viruses was actually done If accident do think it just escaped the lab nearby and very possible the person who unknowningly leaked it went to the market after work If on purpose as bioweapon the researcher could have been knowingly or unknowingly helping USA engineer the weapon as she received research grants from the department responsible for overseeing weapons of mass destruction which makes you think they had full knowledge that this research was potentially weapon The findings of her research she did for them is unknown but she got the funds after she published paper that highlights how she had gotten versions of corona virus to mutate with itself if recall and understand correctly and the studies done with the USA research grants was focusing on how it could be infectious to humans It possible her research was recreated or stolen by USA and released right by the lab in an effort to make it look like it just was poor biohazard control at her labs The reports about exercises in China running drills last year in preparation for such an outbreak makes me think that they were prepared for this to degree and makes you wonder if the theories on population control etc have merit Or they knew the research was stolen at some point and were preparing as reaction to the theft Maybe these Canadian Chinese researchers and or Harvard researchers were just stealing back samples to help the Chinese know for sure what America had taken from them and done with it m probably way of the mark and just have an over active imagination and the first thing said is probably the truth as it the simplest explanation But the conspiracy nerd in me wants to tie this outbreak in China Trump impeachment in USA and even the Australian bushfires all together just cause Morrison was in the states in the days leading up to and the day Trumps impeachment started how it is all related don really know just letting my imagination run wild bit in this last paragraph,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
fkpvg00,From what understand and this could be wrong as m not immunologist but just an undergrad bio major The body has things called cells in their immune system which have subsets of them being memory cells and plasma cells Memory cells have antibodies attached to them while plasma cells just pump out antibodies into the blood How an immune response and production of antibodies works is as follows pathogen will come into the body and will be detected by B cell or Helper cell The cells will have these little keyholes on them that when triggered by the right pathogen will trigger them to turn into the aforementioned memory cells and plasma cells and start creating antibodies The thing is though cells come in different shapes and sizes and each one has different keyholes What more the body has millions upon millions of different cells in the body and thus has millions upon millions of different keyholes Each cell has sort of natural selection thing going on where if its activated they ll turn into memory cell and live on for an extremely long time and if it isn activated it will eventually die However there are some things going on that sway the production of certain keyholes over others and it isn all entirely random chance Evolution dictates that we have production of cells for things like smallpox or measles things that have plagued the human race for while People who possessed the cells against these diseases would live on and pass on their genes and thus it would make it slightly more likely that their offspring would produce cells for smallpox or measles In addition if someone was exposed to something like the flu which is fairly similar to corona the body will start to pump out cells that are kind of similar to the flu it was exposed to and one of these keyholes might fit for coronavirus So exposure and natural selection both play role in deciding the likelihood of person making antibodies for that particular disease Does that make sense ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

femhcel,BEIJING Thailand and Japan each reported new cases of coronavirus that has left two people dead and at least sick in China adding to concerns about the spread of the virus beyond Chinese borders ahead of major holiday Health officials in Thailand on Friday said they had found second case of the mysterious pneumonialike coronavirus in that country in year old Chinese woman The woman is in good and stable condition said spokesman for Thailand public health ministry Rungrueng Kitphati The woman entered Thailand through Bangkok via flight from the central Chinese city of Wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak Investigators were still trying to gather information from the woman but have been hindered by language barrier Mr Rungrueng said On Thursday Japan Health Ministry said that Chinese man in his tested positive for the coronavirus The man resident of Kanagawa Prefecture just south of Tokyo returned to Japan on Jan after traveling to Wuhan The man who came down with fever on Jan was hospitalized on Friday but was discharged five days later because he had recovered according to the Health Ministry The World Health Organization said it was highly likely that the virus had spread from seafood market in Wuhan that also sells live birds and other animals But Japan Health Ministry said the patient had not visited any seafood markets in China adding that it is possible that the patient had close contact with an unknown patient with lung inflammation while in China Malik Peiris public health virologist at the University of Hong Kong said If that was the case that there had been no direct exposure to animals then that is very concerning for sure The disclosures on Thursday and Friday brought to three the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus reported outside of China in the last week On Monday the authorities in Thailand detected the virus in year old Chinese woman who was visiting from Wuhan the capital of the central Chinese province of Hubei Dr Sopon Iamsirithaworn director of the communicable diseases division at Thailand Ministry of Public Health said the woman had not visited the Wuhan seafood market and had come down with fever on Jan However the doctor said the woman had visited different smaller market in Wuhan in which live and freshly slaughtered animals were also sold The woman is in good health now according to Dr Suthat Chottanapund senior official in the disease control department of Thailand Public Health Ministry But he said the health authorities were waiting for laboratory results to confirm that the woman is free of the coronavirus before discharging her She said that she wanted to do some sightseeing after she leaves the hospital he said The revelation that neither the patient in Japan nor the first one found in Thailand had visited the Huanan Seafood Market to which most of the cases have been linked is troubling sign that the outbreak could be spreading in Wuhan The market was shut down and disinfected on Jan but new cases have appeared since suggesting the virus has not been eradicated Concerns have grown across the region since the Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of the mysterious new virus which has sickened dozens of people in Wuhan with pneumonialike symptoms The city health commission said on Wednesday that the risk of human to human transmission is low but possible Officials also said they detected the first cluster of the virus involving members of single family The new virus has stirred memories in China of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS That virus which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets originated in China and killed more than people worldwide in and At the time the Chinese government tried to cover up the problem resulting in backlash among its people While flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now many in China are skeptical The local authorities in Wuhan and the H have reiterated for weeks that no cases of human to human transmission have been confirmed Last week researchers in China said they had initially identified new coronavirus as the pathogen behind the mysterious respiratory illness Of the cases diagnosed in Wuhan the majority of patients are middle age and older men the city health commission said on Wednesday Five people are in critical condition officials said Two deaths have been reported in China both in Wuhan year old man who fell ill on New Year Eve and died Wednesday and year old man who died last week and had previously been diagnosed with abdominal tumors and liver disease The most recent case in China was detected on Jan The minimum incubation period for some viral infections is days suggesting that it could be few more days before the authorities are able to determine the full extent of the outbreak That timeline has fueled concerns among governments across the region especially ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday which begins next week Hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel during the holiday Thailand expects more than Chinese visitors during the holiday according to local tourism officials Hong Kong Singapore Thailand and South Korea have taken precautionary measures quarantining patients with flulike symptoms and increasing temperature screenings at their airports Japan said it was investigating who the patient there had been in contact with since he returned from China and has asked people who experience symptoms to report them While the new coronavirus appears to be less virulent and deadly than SARS many questions remain including the source of the virus and its transmission route Infectious disease experts say the source is very likely to be mammal because coronaviruses spread easily from mammals to humans Coronaviruses are large family of viruses that infect animals and people Symptoms of different coronaviruses can include those that resemble the common cold influenza or pneumonia There no need to panic but think there needs to be an urgency to address these questions said Dr Peiris of the University of Hong Kong The problem is that most of these animals are illegally sold so that might not be so easy to do Dr Peiris said he was encouraged that there were no cases of hospital workers falling ill reducing the likelihood of widespread outbreak within the community as there had been with SARS Guan Yi professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong said he was also reassured that the Wuhan government had not reported any new cases in recent days If there are no new cases in the next few days the outbreak is over said Dr Guan who was part of team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS Eimi Yamamitsu contributed reporting from Tokyo and Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono from Bangkok Elsie Chen contributed research from Beijing ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

fl2vhhn,For those interested made post for some friends about the state of affairs in Japan tl dr We re almost pretending this isn happening and have no idea what the hell the leadership is thinking Many among my friends are currently experiencing what must feel surreal movie like situation the likes of which none of us have seen before For those of us who were alive for it was big deal but it was distant and not quite so immediate This is if not the defining moment of generation For us foreigners in Japan there is different kind of surreality to the current situation While we found ourselves at the centre of attention initially with the Diamond Princess cruise ship failed containment and the government bringing planes of people back from Wuhan without quarantine things have been strangely quiet since school was abruptly cancelled two weeks ago While the rest of the developed world is essentially going into lockdown short of school few theme parks and big events being shut down it largely life as usual in Japan People go to work shop go to restaurants and spend time with their friends Teachers are planning as though this whole thing is nearing its end and school will resume with the start of the new year in two weeks The dichotomy between these worlds is nothing short of surreal To us here it both very real and not happening at all For anyone who got even vague grasp of how the Coronavirus works our situation is completely insane When you look at the rest of the world there is no way you can believe that just closing schools and canceling few major events would be enough to stop it Consider the population density of major cities like Tokyo and think of things like the Subway restaurants bars nightclubs and so on Perfect breeding grounds The crazy thing lot of people who don live here aren aware of is that we don have centre for disease control So there no branch advising on this stuff that independent of the government At the same time we also are testing of the people per capita our neighbour South Korea is and they have over ten times the confirmed infections despite far more rigorous system of controls Until this week our number of cases stayed at around and testing was quite sparse Last Friday Shinzo Abe was granted the power to declare state of emergency and enforce far more extreme measures than he had been able to In the week that followed this we ve quietly seen our cases creeping back up with dozens being confirmed every day To be frank how this appears on the face of things is that after the initial outbreak testing was suppressed to take the spotlight off Japan and closing schools was done to both give good impression to the international community The Yen rebounded immediately upon this announcement it had fallen dramatically following the Diamond Princess fiasco In the meantime Abe moved to acquire the emergency powers he knew he would need keeping testing suppressed to avoid public panic international pressure and market consequences in the meantime Now that he has said powers testing has resumed and will be used with increasing public support as grounds to impose further restrictions Initially thought he would use emergency powers right after getting them but was wrong on that after all if cases were stagnant at and he suddenly issued state of emergency it wouldn exactly make lot of sense would it Unless we re doing something extremely crazy though we re on timer Spring break is coming up and students would normally return to school on the th of April Assuming we re not going back Abe has to make the announcement sometime in the next week or two and likely it will be accompanied by or in proximity to further restrictions being announced This is my best guess as of now But there no way this isn hitting here soon and by my and many others estimates it could be disastrous Okay so that the charitable version of things but one thing really stands out to me Knowing the exponential nature of the spreading of the virus isn what Abe doing kind of shortsighted For every three or so days you wait this problem can easily double in size By the time you realize It really bad stopping there will still result in the peak being lot worse than really bad Italy a good example of this In short what the heck is the government thinking Put on your tinfoil hats because what follows is moderate to extreme speculation that should be taken with full shaker worth of salt Economy Abe is fiscal conservative who pulled Japan out of recession and has survived longer than any other in well long time Everything he done has been calculated to prevent consequences to the economy Counter point Letting this problem get out of control is going to hurt the economy more than the short term consequences of dealing with it in an upfront way like South Korea Is this mistake Is he in difficult political situation where he has no other choice Is there more to it The Olympics Relating to the first point but beyond only the tourism etc payoff Tokyo is or at least was point of pride for Japan It was going to signal its entrance into the international world and was symbol for moving forward With Japan demographic woes too many old people low birth rates may people hitting retirement soon increasing immigration is one of if not the only short term solutions if not the only short term solution that will work Anything that compromises this is an exponentially more big deal to them than it is to anyone else This particular Olympics held special sort of significance in the Japanese mind There some straight up good old fashioned pride involved too Speaking of it Demographics Here the full tinfoil hat point get ready As mentioned in the previous point Japan facing an unprecedented demographic crisis with its aging population Not only does an old population draw on lot of money in terms of pension dollars but also in terms of medical costs as they age and encounter more health problems With smaller young population to support them that puts tremendous stress on the system as whole Which segment of the population does the Coronavirus primarily target Macabre as it might be it a possibility can discount The long game economy part Totally crazy This applies to everyone but m going to focus on just Japan for now Anyone who thinks this is going to be over in few weeks or month hasn looked closely at how this thing works Without vaccine or some incredible sort of anti viral coming out of nowhere as soon as we lower restrictions this thing can start up again It spreads very quickly and subtly and is difficult to trace the lines of infection of It only takes handful of unknown cases in countries with millions of people to get things rolling again and we need to go into full lockdown to contain rinse and repeat or just keep restrictions in place until when year from now when vaccine comes online The economy consequences would be beyond devastating This is the consequence of flattening the curve So what if just what if rather than flattening the curve you allow it to spike bit instead Your approach rather than waiting for vaccine is to let the virus run through your entire population This leads to much higher mortality among the vulnerable see point but Japan does have the most hospital beds per capita in the industrialized world and less important health matters can be put on hold Counterpoint We have ton of old people in Japan there no way this could happen without us looking worse than Italy and there no way Abe could come out of it Prime Minister if ton of people die due to how he handles it At most can see them taking more of Don flatten the curve too much approach where they try to ballpark hit and maintain close to maximum hospital capacity so that they can have large part of the country become immune to it and return to work One thing to consider is that country that comes out of this before vaccines come online for everyone else would have an immeasurable economic advantage over the rest of the world Imagine being the only developed country that people could move around freely in where life was normal It may be that Abe has foreseen the long game pretty typically Japanese and is actually trying to Get things over with One issue with this is that though Japan has the most hospital beds per capita at per it ranks much lower in critical care beds only per Canada sits at and the US at estimate Given that the critical care space is what saves lives this option would have really high mortality Even if we don have cdc we have relatively free press and people can freely communicate with each other online etc It unimaginable that the government would be able to keep Italy level or worse mortality rates under wraps So what the hell is going to happen My prefecture only last week go its first confirmed case on small isolated island Officially it is not yet in my city but am still taking precautions No matter how slice it there something downright villainous incompetent or at the very least as friend put it Machiavellian going on here think of how shocked my office coworkers were to see pictures of bare shelves and empty cities this isn something anyone here has even in their peripheral vision This is one of those times wouldn mind being wrong but the more look at it the less see room for it

fkulvxm, May GENEVA WHO today called on scientists national authorities and the media to follow best practices in naming new human infectious diseases to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations economies and people In recent years several new human infectious diseases have emerged The use of names such as swine flu and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors says Dr Keiji Fukuda Assistant Director General for Health Security WHO This may seem like trivial issue to some but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected We ve seen certain disease names provoke backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities create unjustified barriers to travel commerce and trade and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals This can have serious consequences for peoples lives and livelihoods Diseases are often given common names by people outside of the scientific community Once disease names are established in common usage through the Internet and social media they are difficult to change even if an inappropriate name is being used Therefore it is important that whoever first reports on newly identified human disease uses an appropriate name that is scientifically sound and socially acceptable The best practices apply to new infections syndromes and diseases that have never been recognized or reported before in humans that have potential public health impact and for which there is no disease name in common usage They do not apply to disease names that are already established The best practices state that disease name should consist of generic descriptive terms based on the symptoms that the disease causes g respiratory disease neurologic syndrome watery diarrhoea and more specific descriptive terms when robust information is available on how the disease manifests who it affects its severity or seasonality g progressive juvenile severe winter If the pathogen that causes the disease is known it should be part of the disease name g coronavirus influenza virus salmonella Terms that should be avoided in disease names include geographic locations g Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Spanish Flu Rift Valley fever people names g Creutzfeldt Jakob disease Chagas disease species of animal or food g swine flu bird flu monkey pox cultural population industry or occupational references g legionnaires and terms that incite undue fear g unknown fatal epidemic WHO developed the best practices for naming new human infectious diseases in close collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health OIE and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO and in consultation with experts leading the International Classification of Diseases ICD The new best practices do not replace the existing ICD system but rather provide an interim solution prior to the assignment of final ICD disease name As these best practices only apply to disease names for common usage they also do not affect the work of existing international authoritative bodies responsible for scientific taxonomy and nomenclature of microorganisms ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
fktf95e,Well you earned them This fits rather nicely to my pre existing knowledge and ties up the whole globalistic system even more the Event conference really pieced up who and how rather nicely Yea Crypto was my eye opener to many extent was part of the market prior to crash everyone was buying in due to media and social frenzy surrounding it and kept watching the graphs and it seemed like it will crash any day now actually managed to make lot of money once realized that the whole market is fake and ran by Wall Street bots the human purchesers are irrelevant to the crypto market you can go now to any major crypto exchange and see people buying BTC in millions of transactions daily that doesn happen on regular markets its all bots doing pretendous transactions to justify the price going up and down they make it Plus they have an oversight accross the whole blockchain and each or seperate exchanges so they know exactly what people are buying and in what volume oh someone bought too much btc crash it and stall it till everyone starts panic selling used to follow these pumps amp dumps and work against bots effectively stealing money from the exchanged that they literally stole from regular folks who just wanted to invest into something Its literal madness and people act like its some real thing Here how fucked up this shit is during one instance of crash when ethereum was bucks noticed it was about to dip sold my ethereums for like bucks then it went down to in like minute bought like for the cash got from pulling out minute before it stabilized to in like minutes after the dip and almost made twice the money by the time it got to dollars had shitloads more then when hold Thats how bots do it they wait till they inject into market make everyones value go up and they know people will hold in cases so they have no problem selling on manufactured peaks making people even more desperate once the prices start going down due to their major sellout Its literally the same principle they have been using the stock market for buying out the whole market for pennies on dime due to people not understanding how it works Even this trillion dollar injection past week ended up as private pocket money for those that sold out on the peak after the injection leaving shitload of mid grade traders to buy out overpriced stocks that the top food chain traders are selling because mid grade or lower traders actually think that trillion dollar gonna last and that the value will start climbing back up they made this shit into science Anyway what wanted to say during that Ethereum dip literally the moment it started to fall beneath value had notification from some crypto news site with an article amidst the crypto market crash Ripple stays stable or something like that was like what crypto market crash and started looking at all the graphs from all coins they were all the same identical And it seemed like bot written article as well was just like who the fuck managed to write all this shit down and publish it literally seconds into the market crash am pretty sure it was either bot generated article or someone wrote it before hand No other fucking way it happens But yea only thing was bad at was predicting the time it took them almost months to fuck up the market predicted weeks so lost shitload of money on it if was patient could had robbed these fuckers good This is why am sure they wont crash the system over night its too fast people don like that and panic insues these types of changes need to be gradual till the expected behavior is normalized Either way got out of crypto with some minor losses but know many people that didn listen to me and bought into the whole its just gonna keep rising bullshit and they lost pretty much everything they had invested and most of them invested their life savings so yea that sucks But this is how these fuckers capitalize and conglomerate power this is exactly what happens on wall street they make the market rise with some bullshit explanations implying its connected to real world events then manipulate the market willingly because people truly do believe its tied to real world events And it is to some extent but these bots have been doing it for years so they are far ahead of any human being trader even trying it out they make money by being the first to cash out while the market is on its ups and then they buy out everyone panic selling once the market crashes effectively conglomerating power and each time ending up with bigger share of the market monopolizing and privatizing entire industries if the aero industry takes dips due to less traveling due to corona virus their stocks gonna dip because they aint turning up value to share holders most holders will probably sell to avoid major losses and then these fuckers come to buy it all for pennies on the dime after cashing out on the latest trillion dollar injection said to my friend jokingly no wonder they want older people dead someone needs to ease up the pension fund stress and then read your info and am like ah now see why Corona virus is literally NOTHING to be so panicked about it has death rate among people under age over but fuck man regular cold can kill you at that age Also most of these precautions are pure bullshit people standing meter apart in line and then enter store where they are feet away from the clerk who is standing there for hours people don understand how pathogens spread if someone entered shop and was diseased that shop is an incubation chamber no matter how much meters apart are we used to work in micobiological lab where we had almost near to perfect sterile environment and our products still had like contamination rate and thats with regular mold not even some super spreading virus that Corona is supposed to be This is just sneak peak test they wanna see exactly how low are we prepared to bend so they can stick their giant throbbing swollen dicks even deeper down our tight obedient anal cavities People need to man up and stop living in fear This is why they are able to control us so effectively because everyone is afraid of everything in their life just so they could sip their bullshit coffee and expressos and complain how the world is turning to shit until they turn lol But yea people running the show know this thats why they thrive in situations like these and always end up as winners But yes crypto is not intended for our generation said that many times it is intended for our childrens children because they got tired of money and its becoming hard to keep track of it all this way when you raise kids into the world of crypto as possible means of payment they will embrace it even more until they pass it on to their kids as prefered method of exchange and then they got us all on ledger every transaction forget about paying hooker or buying drugs illicitly Everything will be tracked Fuck Fuck Fuck Shit like this makes me not want to have children but then again would truly like to raise self sustaining person who will fight against this bullshit with his very act of existence Confusing feeling But unfortunately seeing how people are easily persuaded by some media panic frenzy have no problem seeing why they have been able to get away with it from so long As long as we as people cannot agree on what the problem is we will never fix it And they know it Divide and conquer ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
fhdqt37,That an interesting take Here my take made statement about the budget pointed out that the trajectory of the budget has been improving couple of one off events like the coronavirus and the bushfires will probably put the budget into deficit However this won be enough to fundamentally alter the trajectory This thought was perfectly reasonable statement You asked what thought was reasonable question to provide some further detail then provided further detail pointing to the structural budget balance Noting that the structural budget balance had been improving over time This is where the wheels start to fall off for you You seemed to be somewhat incensed by this and taken my explanation as an insult still can figure out why you wanted to talk about Swan last budget pointed out that Swan last budget was mess in the long term because of technical assumption which has since been changed Therefore to try and make an inference about the veracity of the structural budget balance as measure is wrong You seemed to be getting bit heated so didn think me talking about the issue with you would help Additionally it was getting late and know had big day ahead of me So went to bed If you have look at the structural budget balance it has been steadily improving over successive budgets one off event isn going to derail that trajectory can fathom how anyone could think otherwise ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ficgrkq,Full Text The NBA appears to have bought its way back onto China good side The National Basketball Association and the Chinese government had falling out late last year after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted out support for the pro democracy protests in Hong Kong Beijing responded by suspending broadcasts of NBA games and effectively permitting boycott of the association in China On February however the Chinese consul general in New York was offering the NBA his heartfelt thanks While China is bravely fighting the virus people from the United States and all over the world are offering massive support in preventing and controlling this outbreak consul general Huang Ping said during media briefing reportedly loading special thanks on the NBA which has donated million in cash and supplies to charities in Hubei province where the outbreak began In doing so the NBA has joined the ranks of billionaires businesses celebrities and philanthropists that have promised donations to help combat the coronavirus The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged million in support Alibaba founder Jack Ma has committed million from his own charity meanwhile Boeing has shipped masks to frontline staff But not all of these donations are going to China and of the resources that are not all are ending up where they need to be Go NGOs go On January the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that all donations being made to support efforts to contain the coronavirus should be directed through one of five government affiliated charities including the Hubei Provincial Red Cross and the Wuhan Municipal Red Cross two subsidiaries of the Red Cross Association of China But the Red Cross of China is not like the Red Cross overseas which operates as non government agency NGO The Red Cross Association of China is what Beijing calls with no sense of irony government organized non government organization or GONGO GONGOs are usually set up by the government to channel international funding and absorb government officials who were laid off during administrative reform in the They are either spin offs of government affiliated service organizations or direct creations of government agencies and are often led by retired government officials said Li Hui assistant professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong Deploying former officials to the world of GONGOs gives the government direct line to their activities and the former bureaucrats are expected to be more attune to the ambitions and policies of the Party than their civic counterparts The ruling China Communist Party prefers GONGOs over independent civic NGOs Li said which still exist but are regarded with suspicion by officials who view them as threat or at the very least an interference to Party control Foreign NGOs are even less welcome In the central government introduced law requiring foreign NGOs including those registered in Hong Kong or Taiwan to find government sponsor before registering as an NGO The law also brought foreign NGOs under direct supervision of the Public Security Bureaus China police which are able to inspect an NGO finances staff roster and office facilities On the one hand some officials believe that NGOs can help support service delivery and resolve social conflicts and are open to collaborate with NGOs in providing social services to citizens On the other hand the government has devised various policy tools to formally and informally restrict NGOs ability to register raise revenue and engage in political activities Li says The political space afforded to NGOs has been tightening Show me the money The Wuhan Red Cross the GONGO located in the city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic had received over million in cash donations from the public as of February according to local government official It also gotten stockpiles of supplies including over masks protective suits and more than pairs of goggles But on social media frontline medical staff complain that the supplies aren being passed along We appreciate all donations from society and in order to make sure all supplies go to the most needed we have decided to accept donations ourselves without working with the Red Cross said Song Zhan the donation coordination officer for Huoshenshan Hospital the temporary field hospital built in eight days to accommodate the overflow of patients The Red Cross has said there are legitimate reasons why supplies haven been forwarded to the frontlines such as donations of masks that are unsuitable for medical use On February however three officials from the Hubei Red Cross were reprimanded for mishandling donations for the coronavirus prompting an apology from the organization This isn the first time the Red Cross of China has had to apologize for mishandling resources during crisis When an earthquake struck Sichuan province in and killed people the government appointed the Red Cross as the go to charity for handling donations and relief efforts report from Tsinghua University in estimated that of collected donations were funnelled straight into government coffers as extra revenue Side step The shortcomings of China GONGOs might be why some altruists are deciding to make indirect contributions to the coronavirus crisis Of the million pledged by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for example million is going to multilateral agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control CDC and the World Health Organization WHO while million is earmarked for vaccine research The million pledged by the Jack Ma Foundation will primarily fund vaccine research too It is exciting to see that individuals foundations and corporations are donating money and supplies to help those affected by the coronavirus Li said But the crises clearly show that the government and the broader society should work collectively to explore ways to sustain the newly emerged donation culture and support the growth of civic NGOs NGOs are far from perfect just look at the Red Cross in Haiti But in funneling donations to government backed charities China is staking some of its response to the coronavirus crisis on system mired in the same bureaucracy that stymied its initial response to the outbreak ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

fku7anr, The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department is releasing inmates from its jails and cutting down on how many people it books into custody to protect those housed in close quarters from the growing coronavirus pandemic Sheriff Alex Villanueva said deputies and police officers across the county have been directed to cite and release people whenever possible instead of arresting them and to seek medical clearance before booking anyone who shows symptoms Countywide he said arrests have dropped from daily average of to while the jail population was reduced by more than inmates Our population within our jail is vulnerable population just by virtue of who they are and where they re located Villanueva said Monday at news conference in downtown A So we re protecting that population from potential exposure The move came amid mounting calls by civil rights advocates and health professionals to reduce the number of people held in local state and federal lock ups They raised concerns about the mayhem COVID outbreak could create within the prison and immigration detention system which has been criticized for lacking sufficient capacity to meet inmates medical needs even before the pandemic It too easy to forget about those who are in conditions that will be powder keg when COVID hits said Miriam Krinsky executive director of the reform group Fair and Just Prosecution who previously headed the Citizens Commission on Jail Violence What the sheriff identified is good first step but it can be the only thing that we do Chris Beyrer Johns Hopkins University epidemiology professor recalled the case of year old Guatemalan in immigration detention who was treated with over the counter flu medications and died the next morning of acute respiratory distress the same syndrome that makes COVID cases so lethal Nobody should be being detained for not paying parking fee or because they are poor and can make bail Beyrer said We need to be releasing those people yesterday California suspended visitation in state prisons Wednesday and over the weekend broadened that to include overnight family visits Sheriff officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties followed suit San Quentin State Prison has put some inmates in quarantine after reports of flu like illnesses within two cell blocks One of those is the reception unit where new prisoners arrive from jail Prison officials said no inmates have tested positive for COVID but also confirmed that for most inmates the department new protocol requires the results of flu test to be obtained first and if that is negative there is potential four day wait for coronavirus results However the policy directs that prisoners or older or those with chronic medical conditions should be considered for immediate COVID testing The Alameda County public defender last week formally asked local prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to shield some medically at risk jail inmates from virus exposure with combination of early releases and pre trial diversion programs He also asked judges to suspend the practice of issuing bench warrants for the arrest of clients who don make their court dates We are in unprecedented territory and in order to protect our community we are asking for the appropriate authorities to take unusual actions Public Defender Brendon Woods wrote la me coronavirus first responders ALS jpg OPINION Op Ed Your hoarding could cost me my life doctor view from the coronavirus front lines March In Los Angeles County deputies began screening new inmates at its two intake centers the Inmate Reception Center and the Century Regional Detention Facility nearly two weeks ago Before entering the building inmates were asked if they ve left the country recently or contacted anyone who has and whether they have fever or any other symptoms Capt Tania Plunkett said last week yes answer to any of those questions triggered another set of questions and medical professional would respond to the parking lot to evaluate the inmate Depending on the outcome the inmate would either be processed into the jail or sent to medical center Although there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the jails Villanueva said inmates are quarantined at Men Central Jail five are quarantined at Twin Towers Correctional Facility and nine inmates are in isolation at the Correctional Treatment Center It was unclear how many of them if any have been tested for the coronavirus All of them are receiving the necessary level of care Villanueva said He said that since Feb the Sheriff Department had reduced the jail population to inmates including through the early release of inmates who had less than days of jail time left to serve Deputies may now cite and release anyone whose total bail would amount to less than We ve raised it from to Villanueva said Another way we re reducing the population Civil rights advocates last week called for the Sheriff Department to speed up the release of inmates with days or less left of their sentences and to assess vulnerable inmates including those who are elderly or have an underlying health condition for immediate release People in jails are highly vulnerable to outbreaks of contagious illnesses the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California said last week in letter to Villanueva The organization said it had scheduled meeting with the Sheriff Department on Friday Restrictive responses such as lock downs would worsen the conditions for those inside putting their health and safety at risk the ACLU wrote The only meaningful way to keep people inside and outside of the jails safe from COVID is to decrease the total number of people who are incarcerated Ricardo Garcia the public defender of Los Angeles County said in an interview Monday that among his top priorities was to keep people out of custody He said he asked for review of people who are particularly vulnerable to determine those who can be released under safe circumstances We don want individuals who are particularly vulnerable who are homeless to be let out of jail onto the streets again he said He noted that the governor has called on those and older to exercise caution and consider separating themselves People over in jail aren able to do that Garcia said Times staff writer Noah Bierman contributed to this report

fj9ck3j, Nutraceuticals have potential for boosting the type interferon response to RNA viruses including influenza and coronavirus https www sciencedirect com science article pii gt NOX dependent oxidant production inhibits TLR signaling gt gt In light of worldwide concern regarding the recent outbreak of deadly novel strain of coronavirus in China it is fortuitous that two recent discoveries point the way to effective nutraceutical measures for potentiating the type interferon response to RNA viruses gt gt Activation of toll like receptor TLR by single stranded viral RNA trapped within endosomes provides key stimulus to type interferon induction by RNA viruses https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Selemidis and colleagues have recently demonstrated that within the endosomes of human alveolar macrophages such viruses evoke superoxide production by NOX dependent NADPH oxidase complexes the presence of TLR is required for this effect https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb This phenomenon was demonstrated with wide range of RNA viruses including rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus human parainfluenza virus human metapneumonia virus Sendai virus Dengue virus and HIV Furthermore the subsequent generation of hydrogen peroxide within these endosomes leads to an oxidation of Cys on TLR that blocks the ability of this receptor to transmit signal boosting type interferon production In macrophages deficient in NOX activity either genetically or owing to administration of targeted NOX inhibitor gp ds TAT the production of type interferon was markedly higher in response to RNA virus infection When genetically normal or NOX knockout mice were exposed to an inactive strain of influenza virus the interferon beta response and the antibody response evoked by this virus were markedly higher in the NOX knockout mice gt gt These findings point to the possibility that nutraceuticals capable of inhibiting NOX promoting clearance of hydrogen peroxide or aiding restoration of the native structure of Cys in TLR might be expected to boost the TLR mediated induction of type interferon and antiviral antibodies The low nanomolar intracellular concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin generated by activation of heme oxygenase HO are known to inhibit NOX depending NADPH oxidase activity this likely is key homeostatic mission of HO https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Moreover biliverdin the HO product which is converted rapidly to bilirubin within cells has been reported to boost the type interferon response to hepatitis RNA virus in hepatocyte cell lines https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Furthermore HO induction is reported to potentiate the type interferon response to influenza virus https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Phase inductive nutraceuticals such as ferulic acid lipoic acid or sulforaphane are known to promote induction of HO and hence may have some utility for boosting type interferon response https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb The ability of sodium ferulate to activate TLR stimulate type interferon production and enhance survival in influenza infected mice might be secondary to HO induction and possibly reflects an additional effect of ferulate per se as TLR was also found to be activated https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb gt gt Moreover the phycocyanobilin PCB chromophore of cyanobacteria such as spirulina and many types of blue green algae biliverdin metabolite has been shown to mimic the NAPDH oxidase inhibiting activity of unconjugated bilirubin likely because it is rapidly converted within cells to phycocyanorubin compound very similar in structure to bilirubin https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb This phenomenon likely explains many of the profound antioxidant and anti inflammatory effects observed when spirulina phycocyanin the prominent spirulina protein incorporating PCB as chromophore or PCB itself are administered in rodent models of human pathology https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Hence ingestion of spirulina or of spirulina extracts enriched in PCB may have potential for boosting type interferon response in the context of RNA virus infection Oral administration of cold water spirulina extract rich in phycocyanin has been found to decrease mortality in influenza infected mice https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb gt gt The downstream consequences of hydrogen peroxide production might also be addressed by phase inductive nutraceuticals as these induce various peroxidase enzymes and promote the synthesis of glutathione cofactor for certain peroxidases and catalyst in reactions that reconvert oxidized cysteine groups to their native form https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Glutathione production can also be promoted by administration of acetylcysteine NAC which has been shown to be protective in rodents infected with influenza https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb In little noticed month controlled clinical study enrolling primarily elderly subjects those receiving mg NAC twice daily as opposed to those receiving placebo experienced significantly fewer influenza like episodes and days of bed confinement https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Although the rate of seroconversion to influenza was comparable in the two groups indicating that they were exposed at the same frequency only of the virus infected subjects in the NAC group developed symptoms as contrasted to of those of placebo Given the carnage that influenza wreaks among the elderly it is most regrettable that no effort has been made to replicate this study conducted over years ago The particular utility of NAC in the elderly might reflect the fact that plasma cysteine levels and cellular glutathione levels tend to decline with advancing age https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb gt gt Since selenium is an essential cofactor for certain peroxidases and selenium deficiency has been endemic in certain regions of China and other parts of the world insuring adequacy of selenium nutrition might also be appropriate in this context https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb Not surprisingly influenza is more pathogenic in selenium deficient mice and selenium deficiency also increases the rate at which viruses can mutate promoting the evolution of strains that are more pathogenic and capable of evading immune surveillance https www sciencedirect com science article pii bb gt ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
fkvnjp7,By Dana Milbank Columnist March at m EDT So Mitch McConnell thinks his prospective Democratic opponent should stop running mean ads against him during the coronavirus crisis The poor dear As Senator McConnell leads bipartisan efforts to help Kentuckians and all Americans cope with the impact of the coronavirus Amy McGrath continues to run millions of dollars in false negative political advertising designed to tear us apart McConnell campaign manager said in statement Tuesday citing neither ad nor falsehood but denouncing her refusal to stop airing false political advertising during the coronavirus outbreak For McConnell this is most convenient demand With the coronavirus crisis likely to go on for months McConnell could have his reelection come and go in November without anybody running ads detailing how the Senate majority leader the self styled grim reaper has done more in recent years than any other person to embitter our politics and incapacitate government More coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Making McConnell umbrage all the more cynical Groups affiliated with him have gone about their political attacks even as he claims that he should be immune The coronavirus crisis hasn stopped the National Republican Senatorial Committee an arm of the Republican Senate leadership from making statements attacking Democratic Senate candidate and governor Steve Bullock in Montana ran his administration like frat house Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock in Georgia launching political campaign with police report is never good look and Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly in Arizona he for sale to the highest bidder The crisis didn stop One Nation dark money group allied with McConnell from launching new ad campaign this week in support of Sen Martha McSally Ariz and campaign boosting Sen Joni Ernst Iowa The crisis didn stop super PAC run by McConnell allies the Senate Leadership Fund from meddling last month in Democratic Senate primary in North Carolina or this month in Republican primary in Georgia Nor has McConnell expressed similar concern about Republican super PACs attacking Democratic Sen Gary Peters in Michigan Democratic Senate candidate Sara Gideon in Maine and Democratic Senate candidate Jaime Harrison in South Carolina all during the current crisis The Republicans outrage about campaigning during the coronavirus outbreak appears to reflect desire to self isolate Republicans from any political damage from the response to the virus For example McSally this week said she was temporarily suspending her campaign This is not time for politics she said conveniently just as the McConnell associated group began running ads on her behalf No doubt Republicans would like social distancing between themselves and the political fallout from the virus but that not how democracy works Certainly Democrats and Republicans need to work together now and in the future to pass legislation to combat the virus and its economic impact But elections go on during times of crisis and war And the bungled handling of the virus is exactly the sort of mismanagement that should disqualify President Trump from reelection It would be political malpractice if Democrats didn point out that the Trump administration lack of preparedness for the virus and its woeful early response are direct consequences of Trump leadership failures and of congressional Republicans failure to hold him accountable Trump depleted the government of scientific expertise and did little to heed warnings to prepare for pandemic He blocked Congress from conducting meaningful oversight He repeatedly proposed cutting public health and medical research The constant turnover and reliance on acting officials eroded competence His reckless stimulus legislation during an economic boom and his badgering of the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates left few fiscal and monetary tools to stop the ongoing economic panic His constant stream of falsehoods misled the nation about the threat of the virus and contributed to delayed haphazard response His administration badly misjudged the impact of the virus and was claiming until just couple of weeks ago that it would require no additional government spending And now Trump dodges responsibility It snuck up on us he claimed at White House briefing Wednesday This is very unforeseen thing he claimed As for well connected people getting tests when others can he said perhaps that been the story of life He also used the virus briefing to say that m beating Sleepy Joe Biden by lot in Florida that m percent of the Republican Party and that China may be punished for the Chinese virus The Opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life Write to us Snuck up on us Unforeseen Trump dismissed warning after warning after warning Now we work as one to save our lives and our economy But there will be no way for Trump and McConnell to

members of Congress demanded that the United States ban all travel from China It resisted travel bans in lieu of warning people to avoid nonessential travel to China and screening passengers from China at international airports Its decision Friday to deny entry to non nationals who have recently traveled to China and quarantine Americans who are returning from that country marks significant and potentially counterproductive escalation in the S response to the coronavirus crisis Although this may assuage critics who insisted that the administration take more aggressive action history and epidemiology warn us that such measures are unlikely to work Respiratory diseases are not easily contained by travel bans or quarantines Rather than contain an epidemic harsh coercive policies often scapegoat already marginalized populations and intensify panic rather than quell it History offers ample reasons to be wary that authorities may resort to discriminatory measures in the face of frightening disease When bubonic plague came to San Francisco in for example the city twice enacted racially motivated scientifically dubious measures First health officials required that Asian residents be inoculated with an experimental vaccine before traveling outside the city After federal court in rare example of judicial intervention during public health panic struck down that measure the city established quarantine around neighborhood where many Chinese residents lived enforcing it only against Chinese residents That quarantine was also found to be unconstitutionally discriminatory Decades later HIV similarly provoked discrimination against groups perceived to be at the highest risk As children such as Ryan White were kept out of school and well known commentators demanded widespread quarantine the Coast Guard picked up asylum seeking Haitians and quarantined them at Guantanamo Bay Cuba Given that HIV was already widespread as Judy Rabinovitz lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union noted at the time there can be no pretense that this can be to the public health benefit of the United States Fighting coronavirus with travel bans is mistake Our nation most recent disease panic further illustrates what can go wrong when fear rather than science drives the government response to an outbreak In when Liberian citizen Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola while visiting relatives in Dallas and two nurses treating Duncan contracted the illness full blown panic erupted demand for coercive responses grew Despite assurances by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that blood and other bodily fluids were the primary modes of transmission the news media fueled public fear about casual transmission Governors responded by quarantining travelers who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola Although she was not infected Kaci Hickox nurse was involuntarily detained in tent outside Newark International Airport after arriving from West Africa where she had treated patients After Hickox told her story to the media New Jersey Gov Chris Christie allowed her to travel to Maine where state officials sought to quarantine her federal court later dismissed her constitutional challenge to New Jersey actions and federal court in Connecticut likewise dismissed case brought by several people quarantined in that state An appeal of that case is pending The Ebola scare had lasting implications for how the federal government might respond to future outbreaks In the CDC published new federal quarantine regulations Federal law had long given CDC broad powers to restrict international and interstate travel and apprehend and detain people who are thought to have quarantinable disease designation established by presidential order Despite the breadth of that authority the CDC had generally left infection control at least within the country to state and local health departments Indeed the CDC own prior quarantine regulations were remarkably thin offering little guidance as to when and how the agency should exercise its authority The updated regulations provide far greater specificity authorizing the CDC to collect detailed information about travelers health status and detain or bar travel including interstate travel of people who have or are reasonably believed to be infected with quarantinable disease The level of detail in these provisions appeared to signal that the CDC was prepared to assume more robust domestic rule in future outbreaks as it did last week The regulations also created several layers of internal administrative review Critics including one of us worried that the due process review provisions were inadequate allowing people to be detained for relatively long periods while the review proceeded In addition the regulations do not provide for review by an independent decision maker They also do not limit detentions and travel bans to situations in which they are the least restrictive alternative standard that some courts have held to be constitutionally compelled Also absent are protections from deportation and income replacement for people who are quarantined Both protections may be critical to ensuring that people are willing to comply rather than seek to evade quarantine orders In addition to these lapses the regulations have few safeguards to prevent federal officials from wielding their public health powers in ineffective potentially abusive ways And as the Ebola lawsuits show the public cannot count on the courts to protect them from public health overreaches When panic strikes judges are often loath to intervene What then can protect us from plagues and panics Although there are no simple panaceas there are two durable antidotes One is strong and resilient health care system that the public can easily access and in which public health laboratories and hospitals have strong surge capacity Unfortunately as hospitals close and the number of uninsured Americans increases our health care system is facing significant strains The other is trust In times of peril it critical that the public have faith in the expertise and good intentions of health officials When officials are distrusted or rumors are given as much credence as expert advice panic is likely to worsen increasing the chance that the authorities may impose ineffective discriminatory policies Unfortunately the latter antidote may be in especially short supply today Although overall trust in science remains high faith in government is perilously low As scientists are leaving the federal government well known and trusted voices in public health are missing Meanwhile partisanship and tribalism seem to exert more and more influence on how Americans view the challenges we face as nation In such an atmosphere public health officials may lack the tools to calm the public and guide it through health crisis That in turn may enhance the risk that they will employ coercive and discriminatory measures based more on fear of others than on epidemiological best practices If history is any guide such efforts are doomed to make bad situation worse ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

fipw51s,Don remove and don reuse is the basic rule If when you remove them use the loops that are behind your ears to handle the mask Masks with exhaust valves are more comfortable to wear use and are more resistant to becoming damp wet but they too will become damp since you will be exhaling into the mask anyways If had to remove mask and reuse it then would want to have glove in this case even the cheap clear plastic type or even clear sandwich bag would work This is needed to readjust the mask when putting it back on mostly the nose bridge band The mask would be put back on using the ear bands the goal is to avoid touching the outer surface of the mask since that where any contamination would should be stuck at m sure that m gonna get beat down but this is how what would do in the case that there were limited number of masks available and the rules simply cannot be followed Now cleaning disposable masks really don have any ideas it would have to be done in way that wouldn damage the mask filtering element and yet clean it The military uses straight bleach to clean and neutralize PPE can see doing this with reusable silicone masks but for disposable masks seems bit counter intuitive since bleach tends to damage things it comes into contact with Hydrogen peroxide is supposed to be effective at killing stuff and once it done doing it thing fizzing it turns into water So UV and or heat and drying might be the way to go with heat and drying may be the most effective and damage the mask the least From what ve gathered higher temperatures like or more apparently inactivates corona viruses m lay person but would think hot and dry would be the key to inactivating virus The goals would be to use temp that is as high as reasonably possible but one that would definitely not damage the mask So would aim to cook the mask at lets say or or so for like an hour and the masks were bone dry If the masks cannot be made bone dry then the temps should be higher maybe or which would be safe temps for most foods Again m lay person so you will have to do your research and make your own decisions because it easy for me to simply say stuff since this is your health and not mine we are talking about Do the best you can with what you have because you have no other choice Best wishes and good hope to you your family and the people where you are at Be strong and be well ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

fgomtz1,Those who can find bed are called lucky ones Six people in the Liu Xiaoqing family were ill and only three of them were admitted to the hospital More they rely on their own care and find channels The Liu Xiaoqing family may be infected at family gathering The epidemic on January was not considered to be person to person and they ate dinner together outside Soon afterwards the family had fevers from parents and little aunts to year old grandma and then to the aunt and aunt who had returned On January Liu Xiaoqing mother had CT scan which showed viral infection of both lungs After that her mother had high fever for four days almost syncope We contacted many people before we found Hankou Hospital There was bed for her to live in On January her grandma began to develop symptoms and moved to Hannan Hospital Xiehe West Hospital and failed to live in the hospital Grandma waited for day at the clinic and finally got an injection But she trembled immediately like epilepsy and couldn walk and talk normally The doctor left her in the observation ward to inhale oxygen but after returning home her grandmother still had difficulty breathing We looked for lot of talents to be able to live in the ICU of the Sixth Hospital At the time we were also urging the community and Xiehe Hospital but we didn get feedback and news Her father also had difficulty breathing after the injection and used an inhaler Liu Xiaoqing posted the situation to Weibo When he got up at seven the next day he received some useful information and let his father live in ICU My father said that others might think they sent Weibo for help and finally being hospitalized was medical injustice But after all life matters Later she deleted Weibo At am on January th Chen Xiaowei who lives in Shangyi Community Wansong Street Jianghan District Wuhan City dragged the patients to the hospital and finally put on test strip at Xiehe Hospital The test result was delivered on February st showing that Chen Xiaowei was shuangyang diagnosed but when she and her family went to the community to receive the hospitalization form they saw that there was someone in the Shangyi Community Service Point so they would not open the door The family can only choose to call the police The police did not arrive but it was the neighborhood office that the community belonged to found solution Chen Xiaowei said that just this afternoon the Subdistrict Office helped them find bed in Xiehe It finally saved she said In the evening when Chen Xiaowei and her husband arrived at the Western Union Hospital to prepare for hospitalization they were told that they needed to be transferred to the Red Cross Hospital As of press time they are still waiting for beds in the observation room of the Red Cross Hospital Professor Yao Lan deputy director of the Security Center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology said she saw that Macau had requisitioned hotel relatively far from the crowd as centralized management area for people with history of contact in Hubei She suggested that similar measures could be taken in Hubei and other regions to effectively control suspected cases Shen Jun chief assistant of the emergency center of Zhongnan Hospital and director of emergency surgery told Caijing reporter that Zhongnan Hospital is very heavy patient It belongs to patients with very unstable vital signs poor oxygenation fast heart rate fast breathing rate Patients with respiratory distress syndrome There is shortage of beds and those suspected or mild are isolated at home The Central South Hospital team where Shen Jun is located successfully used ECMO Mobile Cardiopulmonary Apparatus to treat critically ill patient for the first time in the province It is reported that the hospital basically has no beds and the emergency department is also used to treat patients with viral lungs The emergency observation room is also full Basically one ward is vacant and the other one is in the ward Shen Jun said that the allocation of beds does not meet the needs of the community but assesses the condition of the patients Some patients for example have been taken to the hospital by their families and they are very sick Obviously can let him go back in line will arrange it when the community report comes Or will not accept him and then take the lighter patient reported by the community to the hospital it is definitely impossible Regarding the test kit he said that the Central South Hospital can perform nucleic acid tests in fever clinics and the results can be obtained in about hours but because the kit is limited patients with viral pneumonia manifestations on lung CT can do it Shen Jun suggested that if possible centralize the isolation and treatment of mild patients so that the epidemic can be effectively controlled He also suggested that patients at home take two medicines antiviral and anti infective with fever exceeding to reduce fever Because there is no specific medicine to treat this disease you cannot follow the trend online Buy any medicine you like Inpatient treatment is also supportive treatment for critically ill patients If this time can be passed it is over Dr Shen Jun and Dr Hu Ming from ICU of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital sweated after surgery In the past two days he had seen year old patient family of five his parents had died of the new

fiecr0o,That not how any of this works Once infected your body will begin manufacturing immune system cells specifically adapted to kill the infection while the front line of the immune system is on damage control Once the body has gone into its total war setting which is when the symptoms are at their most prominent your body is combating the virus directly with these special cells adapted to the virus If you re in good health and receive basic medical attention and follow doctors advice there is very low risk of you having serious complications or dying now After your body has driven off the infection your body has cells in the immune system that are Memory Cells Those memory cells act as like firewall against future infections and if the disease or similar disease enters the body again they mass produce antibodies and replicate themselves so fast that it is near insurmountable defence and consequently you don get reinfected You act as carrier for the disease for around weeks which is fairly long time in our hyper connected world However just because you re carrier for that long there are reasonable chunks of that time where you re pretty uncontagious particularly to mature adult who body is battle hardened against flu flu like strains So once you re infected and you recover you re now safe from this strain and bit more safe against most similar strains The problem lies in that as it spreads so fast because it a coronavirus and they re very similar to influenza strains in how the spread and affect you When it begins to spread uncontrolled like it has in Wuhan and it being downplayed and hidden by the government there no way medical infrastructure can help all those people without major mobilisation This is where the problem lies as without medicine and sanitation and supplies the population is now left with inadequate resources to care for themselves and keep the sick patients in state to maintain such taxing biological defence This is where the virus becomes much more deadly as your body starts to fight war with no reinforcements or ammunition and everyone around you is left in breeding ground that starts to look like Novel Coronavirus perfect paradise You ll see how in first world countries people are being quarantined and given treatment and any hint of the virus is being hunted down like terror threat The death toll in these locations is minimal to none and spread is far lower than that of China or other nations trying to diminish the threat of the virus If countries share information regarding the disease freely scientists across the globe can work in unison to tackle the problem effectively on all fronts and it ll be blip in the history books rather than global pandemic,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
fl9xece,Doctor here Covid is virus similar to the flu even with it symptoms However unlike the flu it travels well really well So well in fact nothing in our history has come close The virus itself can be transmitted directly through of being next to someone infected via any aerosol from their body predominantly cough but even speaking But more than that it can remain in the air for several hours and can remain on surfaces for several days It just so damn efficient at being transmitted the only way we can stop it being passed on is to literally not be near other people So now we have disease that has the capability to infect every single person on this earth Now here the scary part With sufficient medical care the mortality is allegedly across all ages of reported deaths so far e The people who are sick and need to go to hospital in will die in of every person in your country is going to be huge That person in your class work club sports team will die So hopefully that puts that into perspective for you But wait there more That is the number of people who make it to the hospital Without appropriate healthcare the number goes up don think we know quite just how much but believe speculated number was around So now we ve gone from in to in More than triple the number of deaths Just think this Christmas for those who have large gatherings at least of you won be making it But then you might think well that only applies to people who can get healthcare if we can treat we can keep the number lower And you be half right This is virus that has the capability to infect everyone so it fair to say very very significant number of people will need to go to the hospital So once the hospitals get full because so many will have to go in those who can come because there no space left are going to have to just chance it either hoping they re not going to be in the or hoping that hospital somewhere else will have bed So now you might ask we ll how far off are we from having our hospitals full And here another scary fact We pretty much already are Luckily covid has predictable time line of about days so we could have some semblance of good flow however lot can happen in weeks Now comes the take home message The thing want you to do You ve heard it time and time again But ve seen countless people on this sub even in this very thread who just don seem to get it Stay home Do not blame the government for not enforcing lock down do not blame the powers that be for not being prepared Do your part and stay home Don worry about getting yourself tested This is silly notion that you don need to worry about at this time We re beyond this Even if you tested negative it is not in any shape or form an invitation to break quarantine If you do not work in an essential job do not go in It doesn matter if you feel fine You could be carrier Think of every person who you ve come into contact with over the past week These are all opportunities that either you or they have had to propagate this disease We cannot afford to let more people get sick This is disease that will overburden hospitals this is guaranteed it already happening But how much it will overburden is up to you not top dog epidemiologist or ITU super doc but you You who have read this You need to stay home don let yourself be infected and don allow yourself to infect others You won know which one you are since we physically and financially unable to do so But it doesn matter Either way stay away from other people Stay home Stay safe ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

recommended by health agencies At Los Angeles emergency room doctors were given box of expired masks and when they tried to put them on the elastic bands snapped With coronavirus cases soaring doctors nurses and other front line medical workers across the United States are confronting dire shortage of masks surgical gowns and eye gear to protect them from the virus Video transcript Scenes From S

to intubate several elderly patients in respiratory distress without the respirator masks and protective eye gear recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Not only can not protect

optimistic statements contrasted starkly with the situation on the ground particularly in Washington and New York the states with the largest number of coronavirus cases Earlier this week administrators informed doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan that they were down to one week supply of respirator masks but working to get more according to physician familiar with the situation Rebecca Bartles who heads infection prevention efforts for the Providence St Joseph hospital chain based in Washington said it was only matter of days before some of the system hospitals and

clinic and has limited supply of the tight fitting respirator masks in the operating room Like many doctors interviewed she asked not to be quoted by name worried about retribution from administrators for speaking out Federal health officials say respirator masks can be used for eight hours of continuous or intermittent use and should be discarded after treating an infected patient Many doctors around the country said they are being given just one to use indefinitely and they spray it down with Lysol or wipe it off not knowing whether that will help preserve it Many doctors and nurses say their fears and frustrations have been compounded by guidance from the D that they consider unclear and misleading Recently it changed its guidance to say that regular surgical masks are an acceptable alternative when examining or treating coronavirus patient The change came given the shortages of the special respirator masks They get their name because they can filter out percent of all airborne particles when used correctly The agency says that such masks remain essential for doctors during intubations which involve inserting breathing tube down patient throat It is procedure that can more easily spread disease While some infectious disease doctors defend the guidelines noting that surgical masks and protective eyewear are sufficient for everyday patient exchanges others argue the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science The American Nurses Association said the guidelines were creating confusion among its members over how to stay safe Image Medical

necessary personal protective equipment In an email the agency acknowledged the shortages but did not respond to questions about doctors concerns over its guidance Howard Mell spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians said the crisis requires decisive federal action He urged the White House to ramp up production of medical gear through the Defense Production Act powers and he called on federal authorities to increase distributions from the Strategic National Stockpile repository of critical medical supplies for public health emergencies The stockpile has roughly million masks and million surgical masks The Department of Heath and Human Services which oversees the stockpile did not return emails requesting information about the supplies The department has estimated that the country would need billion masks in the event of pandemic lasting year cache of several thousand face masks and other gear from the stockpile recently arrived in Oregon and Washington

fkjev3j, gt As think everybody knows Italy is on quarantine because of the coronavirus outbreak That means that everybody has to stay home unless you ve got valid reasons to go out This situation is bad but what worse is seeing the rest of the world behaving as if it isn going to happen to them We know what you re thinking because we were in your place too gt gt Let see how thing developed keep in mind it all happened in around weeks gt gt STAGE You know that coronavirus exists and the first cases begin to appear in your country Well nothing to worry about it just bad flu mean m not yo so what could possibly happen to me m safe everybody is overreacting what the need to go out with masks and stock toilet paper m going to live my life as usual there no need to freak out gt gt STAGE The number of cases begins to be significant They declare red zone and quarantine one or two small cities where they found the first cases and lot of people were infected Well that sad and somewhat worrisome but they re taking care of it so nothing to panic about There are some deaths but they re all old people with other pathologies so the media is just trying to create panic for views how shameful People lead their life as usual mean m not going to stop going out and meeting my friends and so on am There no need to It not going to get me Everybody fine here gt gt STAGE The number of cases is rapidly going up They almost doubled in one day There more deaths They declare red zones and quarantine the regions where the majority of cases are registered In Italy at this point of the county is under quarantine schools and universities are closed in these areas but bars work places restaurants and so on are still open The decree gets released by some newspaper before it should so around people from the red zone escape from the area that same night to return to their homes in the rest of Italy this will be important later Most of the population of the remaing of Italy still does what it always does portion of the quarantined too They still don realize the seriousness of the situation mean yes everywhere you turn they talk about the coronavirus they advise to wash your hands and limit your going out assemblies of large numbers of people are forbidden and so on every minutes on TV they remind you of these rules But it still hasn settled in people minds gt gt STAGE The number of cases is heavily increasing Schools and universities are closed everywhere for at least month It a national health emergency Hospitals are at capacity entire units are cleared to make space for coronavirus patients There aren enough doctors and nurses they re calling retired ones and those who are in the last years of university there no shifts any more just work as much as you can Of course doctors and nurses are getting infected spreading it to their families and so on There too many cases of pneumonia too many people who need ICU and not enough places for everyone The same goes for respiraty aids don know if that the correct name At this point is like being at war doctors have to choose who to treat based on their survival chance that means that the elderly and trauma stroke patients can get treated because corona cases have the priority There not enough resources for everybody so they have to be distributed for the best outcome wish was joking but it literally what has been happening People have died because there wasn any more space have doctor friend who called me devasteted because he had to let people die that day nurses crying because they see people dying in front of them and can do anything aside from offering some oxygen friend relative died yesterday of corona because they couldn treat him Chemios have been delayed until further notice It chaos the system is collapsing Coronavirus and the crisis it provoking is all you hear about everywhere gt gt STAGE Rember the idiot who ran from the red zone to the rest of Italy Well the entire country has to be declared under quarantine The goal is to delay the spreading of the virus as much as possible People can go to work do the grocery shopping go to the farmacy and all businesses are still open because otherwise the economy would collapse it already is but you can move from your comune which is like municipality guess unless you have valid reason Now there fear you see lot of people with masks and gloves around but there are still are people who think that they re invincible who go to restaurants in large groups hang out with friends to drink and so on Next step gt gt STAGE days later it announced that all most businesses are closed bars restaurants shopping centers all kinds of shops etc Everything except supermarkets and pharmacies You can move around only if you have an autocertification with you which is an official document in which you declare your name where you re coming from where you re going and what for There are lot of police check points if you re found outside without valid reason you risk fine up to and if you re known positive patient you risk from to years of jail for homicide gt gt So that what the situation is like now today as of the Keep in mind that it all happened in around weeks DAYS FROM STAGE TO NOW gt gt The rest of the world apart from Italy China and Korea is just now beginning to reach the other stages so let me tell you this you have no idea what coming to get you know because weeks ago was the one who had no idea and though that it wasn that bad But it is And not because the virus alone is particularly dangerous or deadly but for all the consequences it brings It hard to see all these countries act like it not coming and not taking the precautions that are necessary for the well being of its citizens while they still can so please if you re reading this try to act in your best interest This problem isn going to solve itself by ignoring it Just wondering how many undiscovered cases there might be in America alone is scary and they re in for big big trouble because of how their country is run gt gt Our government for once did good job must say The actions taken were drastic but necessary and this may be the only way to limit the spreading It working in China so we hope it will work here too it already working in some of the first red zones which were quarantined before everybody else Also they re taking measures to protect us citizens such as probably suspending mortgage payments for next months help for shop owners who were obligated to close and so on gt gt realize that these takes are really difficult if not impossible to take in some countries and it really worrying to think about what it could mean in global scale wonder if this pandemic will be turning point in our society what do you think gt gt So guys if there are cases where you live then the virus is spreading and you re maybe or weeks behind us but you ll get to our point eventually PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take any

that the Coronavirus is big deal based on circumstantial and hard evidence fatality rate with an extraordinary contagion rate and Chinese nationals bragging on social media about how they temporarily

fl7txkv,The following are the two main academic sources referenced by those who are convinced COVID originated inside lab gt Researchers likely synthesized the Covid although more studies are needed to be certain NTU professor Fang Chi tai told forum on disease control and prevention in Taipei held by the Taiwan Public Health Association earlier this month gt gt During his presentation Fang outlined several hypotheses raised by Taiwanese and overseas researchers including the probability that the virus was man made and was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology due to gross mismanagement gt gt Fang said the Wuhan facility biosafety level laboratory was used to store handle and research samples of SARS Ebola and other deadly infectious viruses gt gt Given China poor track record of lab safety management including leakage of the SARS virus at state lab in it is possible that virus escaped from the Wuhan facility and resulted in the epidemic Fang was quoted by Taiwan Central News Agency and the Taipei Times as saying gt gt He added that analyses of the Covid virus have shown that it had genetic similarity with an RaTG bat virus also stored at the institute and that the Covid could be manufactured by modifying the RaTG virus gt gt Fang also revealed that French researchers had discovered four more amino acids in the gene sequence of Covid than other known coronaviruses which could be added artificially to make the viral transmission easier gt gt Fang theory is that natural mutations of viruses will only result in small singular changes and it is suspicious to see naturally mutated virus suddenly take on four amino acids gt gt source https asiatimes com covid may be man made claims taiwan scholar gt We are currently witnessing major epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus nCoV The evolution of nCoV remains elusive We found insertions in the spike glycoprotein which are unique to the nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses Importantly amino acid residues in all the inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV gp or HIV Gag Interestingly despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence modelling of the nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site The finding of unique inserts in the nCoV all of which have identity similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature This work provides yet unknown insights on nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus gt gt source https www biorxiv org content It is worth pointing out however that both sources have been retracted This may be because the person making them not longer deemed them credible or because they were pressured Their retraction is the main reason why both sources are often dismissed off hand and their arguments ignored However have not yet encountered any peer reviewed article debunking either of these sources Also there the geopolitical context to consider Lucas Leiroz http infobrics org post research fellow in international law writes gt In fact what the mainstream Western media has called conspiracy has been manifested in US defense programs for long time We must briefly recall the official document named Rebuilding America Defenses http www informationclearinghouse info article htm published by the conservative think tank Project for new American Century where we can clearly read advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to politically useful tool gt gt Taking into account that the document was published in we can see that the possibility of biological warfare has been carefully considered and worked on by American strategists for at least two decades However the projects are even older This article link removed to avoid this comment getting auto censored published in Global Research tells brief history of biological warfare technology tracing the remote origins of this practice by the American armed forces In this genealogy of biological warfare we find reports of the use of bio weapons in wars in great conflicts of the last century such as the Second World War the Korea War and the conflicts with Cuba Even so until last Thursday the mere fact of mentioning this hypothesis for the new coronavirus was rejected as conspiracy gt gt We must attain to concrete data Pentagon has military laboratories around the world whose activities are still obscure the USA has not yet made clear statement about the COVID data in its territory having not yet informed the identity of its patient zero and maintaining uncertain information about the number of infected Chinese scientists conducted complex study in which they concluded that the virus did not originate in China but that it had multiple and diverse sources from the Huanan marine seafood market from where the virus subsequently spread gt gt In February the Japanese media agency Ashi TV http en people cn c html reported that the virus originated in the S not China and that Washington would be omitting its actual numbers with some cases of death attributed to influenza being in fact camouflaged cases of coronavirus on February Taiwanese virologist presented series of flowcharts on TV program https weibo cn status amp video corroborating the thesis that the virus has an American origin providing scientific explanation to the flow of the virus sources devoid of any geopolitical purpose gt gt Another curious fact is that China has been unexpectedly affected by epidemic phenomena particularly during the period of the trade war between Beijing and Washington Only between and the beginning of the country recorded epidemic episodes of N N two variations of bird flu and African swine flu Also the US has not officially responded to any of these notes remaining silent about the coronavirus situation in its territory gt gt Not proposing concrete answer but only speculations we can consider that the circumstances of the case present us very extensive list of possibilities about what in fact the coronavirus is Obviously it is possible that it is not biological weapon and this is the official version of most of the media agencies and governments however once this hypothesis has been raised and no concrete evidence to the contrary is presented it is also possible that it is biological weapon gt gt The most important thing to do is to dispel the myth that biological wars are conspiracy theories We must begin to take this possibility seriously and analyze the evidences in search of real solutions Biological weapons are methods that have long been used and that form fundamental part of modern warfare whose costs are less than the methods of direct confrontation of the old wars of mobilization and whose benefits are greater The more research do on this matter the more obvious it seems to me that COVID was indeed bioweapon created in lab by the US military or private organization associated

fjitmv1,Why is South Korea experiencing an unprecedented spike in the COVID infection number Because the incubation period of covid is very long meaning that when the infection number started to spike that was only the results of the epidemic control measures of about days ago Despite the media and governmental attention on Shincheonji they have only been half of the problem The alarm bells didn work the containment measures were poor Reuters has very informative infographic site https graphics reuters com CHINA HEALTH SOUTHKOREA CLUSTERS G SB index html Basically the first untraceable community cases were patient and who were admitted to Seoul National Hospital on th Feb This means that patient and were infected at around the beginning of Feb Whether they are related to Shincheonji or not this should have been warning alarm for the South Korea healthcare authorities but it unfortunately wasn Patient was member of Shincheonji She started to show symptoms sometime around Feb th meaning that like case and she was infected sometimes in end of Jan and beginning of Feb On the th doctors advised her to to test for coronavirus but she didn listen went to several other places On the th she went to the hospital to test for covid and was tested positive She was subsequently assumed to be super spreader and blamed to the subsequent rise of infected cases But was she really super spreader The epidemic didn just suddenly come into existent in South Korea without at least imported case getting through unchecked Right after patient was discovered score of people were subsequently discovered to be infected On the th the total number of people infected was people On the th it was people By that time the infection was widespread enough inside Daegu for random military personnel with no known connection to Shincheonji visiting his home to catch it and go on infecting several others inside the military which should have been the reserve resources when the epidemic spread nationally but was in actuality compromised and deactivated early on These people weren infected the day before they were discovered They were infected sometime between weeks ago at the beginning of Feb From then on the reported infected cases have started to climb on very clearly exponential graph Despite the media attention it was very clearly that patient was unlikely to be the cause of the infection for the people discovered on the th and th but they all were likely to be infected at around the same time at the end of Jan and beginning of Feb The disease has been silently transmitting among the populace for half month the alarm bell of which should have been the discovery of patient and never mind patient Unfortunately even when patient started to show symptoms there was no action from the South Korean government and healthcare authorities to at the very least quarantine the suspected case from going all over the place In hindsight they were basically choosing the rights to be idiots of the Shincheonji cult over the health of and counting South Korean citizens Furthermore in the Reuters graphic you can see that there are at least clusters in development Shincheonji Cheongdo Daenam Hospital Busan Onchun Church and others Cheongdo Daenam Hospital was also where the brother of the Shinchoeonji leader died and had funeral from January to February and the brother died of you guessed it pneumonia To sum it up somebody died of pneumonia in the middle of an epidemic and no healthcare authorities moved to verify whether the dead had covid or not and allowed said funeral to last days with several thousands visitors in hospital with lots of patients in the mental ward and immuno compromised and old people place where would be the most dangerous source of transmission if compromised Which it was Furthermore even after Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk blew up as of Feb th days after patient tested positive and it became clear that Shincheonji was part of the problem the South Korean government refused to restrict travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk to other provinces and countries just because China did it so it must be bad and human rights violation kid you not an excerpt from Washington Post https www washingtonpost com world asia pacific in south korea region is stricken with coronavirus but no china style lockdowns planned e bf ea efd bdd story html When spokesman for South Korea ruling party suggested Tuesday that the government would be rolling out maximum lockdown on the coronavirus hit southern city of Daegu the backlash was immediate and the political retreat swift Hong Ihk pyo soon clarified that he didn mean Wuhan style lockdown or blockade on travel into and out of the city along the lines that China Communist Party has imposed on Wuhan and surrounding areas at the center of the covid outbreak President Moon Jae in soon chimed in There would be no regional blockade he said only full scale effort to contain the spread of the virus The measures include tracing and testing potential carriers canceling large public gatherings and marshaling the country medical and financial resources with help from the police and the military But as South Korea struggles to contain rapid acceleration in coronavirus infections one thing is clear The kind of tactics imposed by the authoritarian regime in China are simply not on the menu in this compact democratic and politically outspoken country Of South Korea nearly confirmed cases of the disease named covid caused by the novel coronavirus are in Daegu and another in the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang with major burst of cases linked to megachurch All but one of the deaths have taken place in the city or province Some kind of travel restriction on Daegu citizens might have been helpful to contain the virus but it was just out of the question said Choi Eun hwa professor of medicine at Seoul National University and member of an expert panel that met Moon on Monday The South Korean government can afford to enforce that kind of restriction as it would spark huge backlash Yeah and as far as know they still haven restricted travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk as of now March th when the number of infected has surpassed the epidemic has spread to all South Korean provinces hospital in Seoul became new cluster of reported confirmed cases after importing case from Daegu while China is well on its way for recovery in part thanks to its strict travel restriction measures both inside the country and to other countries At the end of January China placed travel restriction on Chinese nationals in China from going on tours to other countries On February th the South Korean government accused the Vietnamese government of quarantining Korean nationals from Daegu to Vietnam without prior notice in the middle of pandemic when the number of cases in South Korea was in the The South Korean media subsequently labeling countries with special focus on Vietnam that have imposed travel restriction on travelers from South Korea Koreaphobic despite anyone with eyes can see that the epidemic was blowing up fast in South Korea and the South Korea government still hadn restricted travel for its nationals within the country and to other countries In comparison despite China initially putting pressure on countries that had put travel ban on travelers from China China response and travel ban of its citizens to other countries even if bit late was downright charitable To sum up part The South Korean government lack of containment measures when things start to go off the rail made the epidemic uncontainable now and the alarm bells within weeks didn work ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fgnjiow,I have been doing research into the origin of this virus and how likely it was spread from single Wet Market in Wuhan Based on the rapid spread of this virus and the likely numbers of infected being modeled by multiple Scientists and Researchers throughout the world fear that the chance this virus was spread from single contaminated animal dead or alive directly to humans to be unlikely My theory is that this virus may have jumped from Bats to Rats within the Wuhan Wet market or elsewhere and the wild rat population has been spreading the virus along with H transmission since the initial infection event occurred Rats are major problem in Chinese cities as well as in rural areas and the un sanitized Wet Markets are no exception Wet Markets also present an environment in which viruses can jump cross species fairly easily due to the mixing of blood urine and feces on the floor of the markets and in the drainage systems which are likely frequented by rats looking for an easy meal The following study was undertaken in using samples of SARS like Coronavirus that were taken in and from Bats by the Institute of Military Medicine Nanjing Command Nanjing In this study researchers infected rats with tissue samples that tested positive for the virus The study illustrated that the virus was capable of replicating in rats and spreading between them through coughing urine and fecal spread The virus was noticeably prevalent in the brain tissue and lungs of these rats who showed symptoms such as lethargy depression fatigue and pnuemonia like respiratory symptoms The main takeaway from the study is that These results indicated that the virus can circulate and proliferate in infected rats https www researchgate net publication Genomic characterization and infectivity of novel SARS like coronavirus in Chinese bats https www researchgate net publication Genomic characterization and infectivity of novel SARS like coronavirus in Chinese bats Going back to the samples that were taken in and The following shows that the samples share an identical protein group for an envelope protein with the Wuhan strain of the coronavirus After Blasting the new Wuhan strain analyzing for shared genetic sequences these two sample strains shared and query coverage along with and percent identity to the new Wuhan strain of the virus The identical envelope protein suggests that the samples taken in are predecessors to the current Wuhan strain Query Cover The query cover is number that describes how much of the query sequence is covered by the target sequence If

fk573zf,I seriously concerned that may have had it but it is so hard to tell given the similarities between flu and the virus About weeks back went out on very cold night to few bars and felt tingle in my throat by the next day For week my throat hurt and was little stuffy but then my head cleared by the weekend and all was good went back to work the following Monday Monday My boyfriend came home feeling really ill He was kind of out of it and had low grade fever but we just figured he got what got made us some food and joked about how couldn catch the same thing twice Tuesday The next morning was bad We both woke up with extreme muscle fatigue fevers around There was no cough at first just headaches body aches but nothing related to the stomach either We both slept all day and took turns trying to get fevers down Any small thing pushed the fever right back up Neither of us went into work Wednesday holy shit we felt like we were dying The worst part was by far the body aches We couldn stand up for any extended amount of time Once again fever all day The coughing started but almost feel like it seemed so minor next to the headaches fever aches and fatigue that it seemed like it wasn that bad At this point we were downing DayQuil NyQuil ibuprofen We were on days of not eating Nothing made us nauseous we just had no energy to eat or drink Thursday don even remember this day remember not knowing what day it was remember sitting on the couch coughing up lung and not even being able to close my mouth afterward so just sat there slackjawed on the couch Ate few bites of oatmeal Fever continues up to Friday think this was the day started feeling nauseous Still fever was down lbs at this point and ate packet of plain oatmeal felt super dizzy and went to the bathroom and had the most violent non productive puking sesh of my life Somehow my body kept the oatmeal down but seemingly pushed about cup or so of dark greenish yellow fluid it was the consistency of phlegm which was likely from my respiratory infection felt little better after this but know that really began coughing after this point did not throw up again but did experience diarrhea after trying to eat few bites of pizza for dinner called the MDLive line and they immediately prescribed me tamiflu and tessalon and said it just sounded like the flu Saturday still out of it but was able to walk around Any small amount of walking or moving caused me to feel extremely fatigued Shortness of breath started happening especially while lying down Exhaling was actually really difficult and my arms and legs were tingling took like hot showers to try and clear the extremely thick dark phlegm to help this but was producing that plus some white foamy shit inconsistently My throat started hurting again and lost my voice Went to bed sitting upright and woke up multiple times feeling like couldn get enough oxygen Sunday chest pains and shortness of breath Finally decided to go to ER after calling hr nurses line and they told me to go Arrived at small ish hospital where they had me put on mask and took me in immediately to do an EKG then moved me to an ER bed Door was sealed not locked and everyone in out wore masks waited in the bed about hours before they came in to take me for chest rays Another hour after that they came back and the doctor said who told you you have the flu told him called MDLive and they said it sounded like the flu Doctor said well we aren going to test you for the flu We got your blood back and we don see anything viral You probably have influenza and your chest rays weren that impressive told him hadn had my flu shot and that caught this within hrs of contact with my bf who experienced all the above Neither of us have traveled or been in any direct contact areas but we do live in an area where it spreading He gave me an albuterol treatment and prescription for prednisone then left the door open on my WR room The albuterol helped very slightly but was only temp was back at work on Monday so one total week away from work ve been coughing ever since Experience little chest pain here and there likely muscle pains from coughing Fever is gone Im still really concerned that was never confirmed for flu m not sure if coronavirus can be checked via blood or what he meant by there was nothing viral in my blood know few people who had similar symptoms and think it was just the flu It likely was ve never felt that sick in my life and ve had the flu multiple times so it really hard for me to reconcile feeling what did with just flu do believe that there are so many people in the IS who have already had the virus and just don know ,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

me By Carl Goldman Carl Goldman is the owner of KHTS radio https www hometownstation com in Santa Clarita Calif Feb at m EST have the coronavirus And it hasn been that bad am in my late and the sickest ve ever been was when had bronchitis several years ago That laid me out on my back for few days This has been much easier no chills no body aches breathe easily and don have stuffy nose My chest feels tight and have coughing spells If were at home with similar symptoms probably would have gone to work as usual caught the virus on the Diamond Princess the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for days at the end of day cruise took with my wife Jeri When left the ship couple of weeks ago felt fine We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine Jeri amp got swab test for the virus Our temperatures were normal they get the swab results back in hours Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport where two S government planes waited for us As we took off from Tokyo had bit of cough but chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin felt pretty tired but who wouldn in our situation dozed off When woke up had fever made my way to the back of the cargo plane where the Air Force had set up quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic They took my temperature It was over degrees So took seat in the quarantine area amp fell back asleep until we touched down in California at Travis Air Force Base Officials from the Centers for Disease Control amp Prevention came onto the plane amp said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha with our spouses if they wanted to come along The CDC had quarantine location at the University of Nebraska hospital We arrived on Feb greeted by fleet of ambulances amp police cars Officials put me on stretcher amp wheeled me into van which made for very dramatic scene easily could have walked myself despite my exhaustion On the hospital campus they put me in biocontain unit The space was sealed off with two double paned windows that looked out on the hallway amp large heavy insulated door Two cameras watched me at all times set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones so that the medical staff amp could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in doctor amp nurses reviewed my case with me amp took bunch of lab tests They wore heavy duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape amp equipped with motors that helped with air circulation It looked like something out of The Andromeda Strain When the test came back few hours later wasn surprised to learn that had the coronavirus Later the Tokyo swab confirmed the result had caught the virus even before left the ship It didn scare me too badly knew my number was up The way saw it was going to get stuck in at least more days of quarantine even if didn get the virus So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness including one of my friends that d gotten somewhat used to the idea that might catch it too My wife however tested negative and headed to quarantine at separate facility few blocks away After those days being cooped up on the ship together think we both relished the alone time we still could communicate through our phones During the first few days the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV mostly as precaution and used it to administer magnesium and potassium just to make sure had plenty of vitamins Other than that my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade and when my fever rose just above degrees some ibuprofen The nurses came to the room every four hours or so to check my vitals ask if needed anything amp to draw my blood got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level blood pressure amp heart rate so could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room little to get my blood flowing never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making tangled mess After days moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines in neighboring rooms As of my most recent test on Thursday am still testing positive for the virus But by now don require much medical care The nurses check my temperature twice day and draw my blood because ve agreed to participate in clinical study to try to find treatment for coronavirus If test negative three days in row then get to leave The time has passed more quickly than would ve expected With my laptop get as much work

fg51gk3,For retroviruses with RNA instead of DNA like coronaviruses they use RT qPCR primer is used that matches small fragment of nucleotide sequences that are typically preserved and unchanged in most viruses sequences in the coronavirus family This primer is used as starting point for transcription enzymes to everse ranscribe the RNA into DNA which is subsequently amplified via PCR polymerase chain reaction The signal generated and detected from this amplification eg fluorescent tag sequence that was encoded into one end of the primer you used that also becomes incorporated into each DNA strand that is produced would suggest that genetic material is present that contains sequence that is typical of the virus you are looking for This genetic material can then be inserted into vector plasmid circular DNA which can then be transformed into bacteria to be grown in order to clone the DNA to large enough quantity for subsequent sequencnig Then the DNA segment from these bacteria are cut out isolated and sequenced The DNA sequence can then be compared against database of known sequences If there are significant differences in sequences then one can conclude that the initial RNA viral sample you started with is new would imagine that with this new sequence on hand more specific primers can be created that only bind with the newly discovered RNA strand with high affinity while weakly binding with other coronavirus genetic sequences Strong RT qPCR signals generated from these new primers can then be used to determine and diagnose people who are infected with this particular new coronavirus strain ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
fgocpik, Part Two Question Would you be able to explain how the mathematical modeling that your team is doing can inform policy and government response Yes statistical mathematical analysis of epidemic data has quite long history and it really become quite established within the policy framework policymaking framework used Particularly in the UK but think further afield And that often because what we have is very noisy and limited data in an outbreak and we want to be able to get the most information from that as possible So advance statistically modeling and then later mechanistic transmission modeling can be useful in doing that So simple questions we try to answer is how transmissible is the new pathogen how long has it been circulating how much are cases cases are always underestimated in epidemics surveillance is never perfect so ow large is the real epidemic And then critically important to how people respond is how severe threat does this pose to human heath Question Would you be able to explain little bit about the uncertainty ranges around the estimates that you report The uncertainty is always high early in an epidemic particularly in disease we have never seen before We don know critical things like how long does it take from when someone is infected to when they develop symptoms of the incubation period we don know how transmissible the disease it We try to estimate these things from quite limited data And the limited data means there always uncertainty in the estimates which we try to characterize using state of the art statistical methods So often we we ll quote something like we think every case generates other cases on average something called reproduction number But there will be range around that it might vary from anywhere between up to or something and that captures how much we know about that particular parameter of interest Question And then with that uncertainty range how useful is that to inform policies and governments ANSWER In general policy makers would like everything to be certain So handling uncertainty is challenge think the uncertainty range tells them what confidence we have in the estimate If we have calculated it correctly So if we for instance say well the case fatality ratio the proportion of people that might die in an outbreak varies could be anywhere from in to in that not terribly informative estimate If we can say precisely the estimate is of case fatality of people will die it could be half percent it could be that is much more useful estimate Question And do you have any suggestions as to what the most efficient interventions would be at the moment for either China or internationally ANSWER Unfortunately for this virus we have limited options for interventions at the current time We have no vaccine through vaccines are rapidly being developed but it will take months if not years to develop And some testing of anti viral treatments existing drugs being repurposed to see if they work in infections in these cases The other measures we have to draw upon are called public health interventions So identifying as many cases possible as early as possible in their disease and isolating them is how we managed to control for instance the SARS outbreak genetically quite similar virus to this new virus Weather those measures will be as effective in this case remains to be seen This virus has much wider range of severity of symptoms Quite lot of people being infected may just have quite milder of disease Might no even seek health care for it If those people are transmitting then it will be very hard to stop transmission overall So the next few weeks will really tell us about the likely hood of control measures working So in terms of intervention the Chinese have been throwing everything they can at this outbreak for the last it only two weeks In terms of what might work that critically depends on who is transmitting infection wether the people who are responsible for most onward transmission are being identified and isolated early enough The Chinese are currently focused on identifying severe cases and isolating those It unclear weather the mild cases left in the community and we thing that the majority of the cases are still sustaining the outbreak or not We ll know more in the next couple of weeks At the moment we can see much evidence that the epidemic slowing down QUESTION There have been few fatalities outside mainland China Would you be able to explain why that is Why we see that difference with the fatalities that we see in China So looking at the severity of an epidemic and looking at how many people might eventually die from it is very challenging There were delays quite often long delays from when someone is diagnosed with an infection that may be reported in the media for instance in Thailand or Japan or Hong Kong and when we finally know what the outcome of that case is People will persevere cases will be in intensive care maybe for weeks We think the delay from when somebody is develop symptoms to when they might die is as long as days or longer three weeks or so So the fact we haven seen many deaths in travelers we ve seen two so far for cases detected outside of mainland China is not terribly reassuring We wouldn have expected to see vary many so far because of those delays in the system What we are trying to do now is account for those delays and do an accurate estimate of how lethal we think this virus is How worried are you about this kind of outbreak The outbreak is clearly of concern It probably the most major we call it emerging infectious diseases the world has seen since at least since the pandemic of influenza in and maybe since the SARS outbreak in So we don fully know enough to be able to estimate the full scale of disease burden we call it which will affect the human population how many people will die But it something that certainly governments need to prepare for urgently in terms of ramping up health system preparedness and in particular undertaking rapid research to try to develop treatments which can reduce potential fatality in severe cases of disease How is the work that you do funded So the funding for the work we do here comes from number of sources We are fortunate to have generous institute funding from Community Jameel to fund our work not just on responding to outbreaks but much broader work on how the world responds to other forms of health crisis includes climate change and the like We then receive lot of research funding from individual research funders within the JIDEA we have the MRC center for global infectious disease analysis generous funding from the UK medical research council we receive lot of funding from other funders as well ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
fkv4uwh,I not the OP but here is the text Text of Times article by Jonathan Leake Science Editor Thousands of coronavirus victims who survive serious illness will suffer damage to their lungs heart and other organs needing up to years for recovery say intensive care specialists The damage done by the virus directly plus the intensive medical procedures needed to save desperately ill patients will leave people with lung scarring nerve damage and psychological trauma according to warnings from the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine FICM the professional body responsible for training intensive care doctors in the UK Its analysis of coronavirus cases in China and elsewhere shows that about of people admitted to intensive care develop condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome Ards one of the most lethal conditions in medicine with mortality rate of about The impact of coronavirus on intensive care will fundamentally change the way nursing medical and other staff groups work during the pandemic and the intensity with which they will work said Dr Daniele Bryden vice dean of the FICM In Ards the virus triggers powerful inflammatory response across the lungs which causes fluids to leak from blood vessels into spaces that should be filled with air making breathing impossible without medical assistance Intensive care doctors are familiar with Ards because it can happen in infections such as flu and pneumonia as well as chest injuries It accounts for about of intensive care admissions but coronavirus means the number of Ards patients will surge creating critical shortage of intensive care beds The UK has about such beds far fewer per head than most EU countries and about are in use for people with other conditions Ards kills of patients said Michael Matthay professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco world expert on the disease There is no specific treatment except to sedate patients and put them on mechanical ventilators to let them recover Survivors have significant exercise limitation and poor physical quality of life related to marked muscle wasting and weakness Eileen Rubin who spent weeks in drug induced coma after acquiring Ards through lung infection and who now runs the US Ards Foundation said Ards is like drowning in air But even if you recover the damage lasts for years Those of us who have had Ards are living in fear of what coronavirus might do to us and to others Mark Griffiths professor of critical care medicine at the National Heart and Lung Institute London and one of the UK leading Ards experts said patients could take months or years to recover Survivors commonly suffer from muscle weakness and neuropsychiatric problems such that fewer than have returned to work months after leaving intensive care he said in paper They also had myriad physical disabilities including joint contractures tracheal stenosis and cosmetic concerns related to scarring The FICM said that some people could regain apparently normal lungs after six months with minimal symptoms such as reduced ability to exercise but added For some however it could take as long as years for their lungs to recover It also warned of damage to other organs Like many other viral conditions the effects of coronavirus are not just limited to the lungs The heart can also be affected ranging from inflammation myocarditis to heart failure For people who are seriously ill with coronavirus the outlook is very serious said Nicki Credland researcher in critical care at Hull University who chairs the British Association of Critical Care Nurses She warned of tough choices to come with doctors potentially having to select whom they should save process known as triage She said If we see the kind of numbers we ve seen in Italy then we will have to select those who are most likely to survive and the rest will be in ordinary beds and have to take their chances There may however be one cause for hope The US Food and Drugs Administration has recently decided to fast track potential Ards therapy that has shown promising results in medical trials Other agencies including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority will evaluate the therapy to decide if its development should be accelerated Geoff Bellingan medical director at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been testing the therapy devised by Athersys US biotechnology company It involves infusing specialised stem cells into the blood of Ards victims to halt the devastating lung inflammation it causes The Ards trials are exciting said Bellingan Our treatment was able to halve mortality reduce time spent in intensive care and give patients big improvement in quality of life after they are discharged With coronavirus threatening us this could be very important ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Wucinski and his daughter Annabel in Marine Corps Station Miramar where they were quarantined after arriving from Wuhan China Frank Wucinski and his daughter Annabel in Marine Corps Station Miramar where they were quarantined after arriving from Wuhan China Credit Courtesy Frank Wucinski Frank Wucinski and his year old daughter Annabel are among the dozens of Americans that the government has flown back to the country from Wuhan China and put under quarantine to check for signs of coronavirus Now they are among what could become growing number of families hit with surprise medical bills related to government mandated actions Mr Wucinski Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years accepted the S government offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel in early February as the new coronavirus spread His wife who is not an American citizen and remains in China developed pneumonia that doctors think resulted from Covid the disease caused by the respiratory virus Her father whom she helped care for was infected and recently died The first stop for Mr Wucinski and Annabel was two week quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego During that time they had two mandatory stays in an isolation unit at nearby children hospital The first started upon arrival in the United States and the second was few days later after an official heard Annabel coughing The hospital staff were very nice they brought us lot of toys Mr Wucinski said Each time it was three or four days love my daughter to death but being in the same room that long she is not great conversationalist Both have repeatedly tested negative for the virus After their release from quarantine Mr Wucinski and his daughter went to stay with his mother in Harrisburg Pa That where they found pile of medical bills waiting in charges from hospital doctors radiologists and an ambulance company assumed it was all being paid for Mr Wucinski said We didn have choice When the bills showed up it was just pit in my stomach like how do pay for this The Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions Updated Feb What is coronavirus It is novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS How worried should be New outbreaks in Asia Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of global pandemic The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States How do keep myself and others safe Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do along with staying at home when you re sick What if m traveling The D has warned older and at risk travelers to avoid Japan Italy and Iran The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China How can prepare for possible outbreak Keep day supply of essential medicines Get flu shot Have essential household items on hand Have support system in place for elderly family members Where has the virus spread The virus which originated in Wuhan China has sickened more than people in at least countries including Italy Iran and South Korea How contagious is the virus According to preliminary research it seems moderately infectious similar to SARS and is probably transmitted through sneezes coughs and contaminated surfaces Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between and people without effective containment measures Who is working to contain the virus World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China where growth has slowed But this week as confirmed cases spiked on two continents experts warned that the world was not ready for major outbreak Mr Wucinski employer standardized testing company did provide health benefits when he lived in China but does not offer coverage in the United States Patients in the United States regularly confront surprise medical bills that are hard to decode Mr Wucinski case suggests that those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no exception The federal government does have the authority to quarantine and isolate patients whom officials believe to be public health threat These powers which date back to cholera outbreaks among ship passengers in the late th century are rarely used They don say anything about who pays when the isolation happens in nongovernmental medical facility or when they re brought there by private ambulance company There is no uniform practice said Lawrence Gostin professor of global health law at Georgetown University They do have the powers but they ve almost never used them in modern times While the number of patients held in mandatory isolation is currently small it is likely to grow if the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States Eleven cases were confirmed in San Antonio on Friday evening Earlier in the day public health authorities identified second case in California and first in Oregon where patients who had not traveled to an affected country became infected Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman declined to comment on whether it would pay the bills of patients kept in mandatory isolation Mr Gostin worries that high charges for mandatory isolation could make patients wary of seeking needed medical treatment The most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of the population he said There are legal moral and public health reasons not to charge the patients These hospital stays could prove expensive The International Federation of Health Plans estimates that the average day in U hospital costs compared with in Australia and in Spain They may be especially costly for patients without health insurance or those who have large deductibles which they must pay before their health benefits kick in Mr Wucinski recalls other patients asking questions about how medical bills would be handled during daily town hall meetings for those quarantined at the Marine Corps station He felt the answers weren clear He did receive document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact government email address with any medical bills He sent an email on Feb detailing the charges and asking what would be done My question is why are we being charged for these stays if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter Mr Wucinski wrote in his message His email has not yet received response he said When contacted by The New York Times Rady Children Hospital spokesman said that the bill from their physicians had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges We re in the process of assessing how the error occurred the spokesman Benjamin Metcalf said We are working with government agencies regarding billing for these cases But the hospital bill only represented fraction of those the family received The ambulance company that transported the Wucinskis American Medical Response charged the family for taking them to the hospital company representative declined to comment on the bill due to patient privacy concerns but said the company would look into the case An additional in charges came from radiologists who read the patients ray scans and do not work for the hospital Having such doctors who may be outside patient insurance networks provide services to hospital patients is one of the major causes of surprise medical bills The radiologists employer San Diego Medical Imaging Group did not respond to request for comment Mr Wucinski is looking into whether he or his daughter might qualify for Medicaid the public insurance program that covers low income Americans Some news outlets have seized on the fact that he coughed enough on recent television interview to require water Mr Wucinski recently noticed that his daughter is blinking lot and hopes to get the issue examined by doctor but is worried about the charges they may face He has wondered whether the stress of the past month and the separation from her mother has played role should take her to the doctor this week for checkup but we don have insurance so it just going to have to be cash he said Sarah Kliff is an investigative reporter for The New York Times Her reporting focuses on the American health care system

fk2rv0w,Translation The Ministry of Health starts to test for coronavirus all patients who come to health units with mild or severe flu regardless of travel history The measure applies to samples with negative results for other flu viruses in cities with confirmed cases of the disease Thus the portfolio expands the identification of coronavirus cases and reinforces the monitoring of circulation in the country With this the Ministry of Health adopts the third definition of the World Health Organization WHO of suspected case of coronavirus The WHO definition for testing hospitalized patients with severe cases has the objective of identifying possible community transmission which occurs when it is not possible to trace the source of the infection It may be that we can identify the community transmission of the virus in Brazil as Canada has already done Therefore we have increased the sensitivity of surveillance in the search for supposed community transmission of the coronavirus which will allow us to organize our system better and faster operational said the executive secretary of the Ministry of Health Jo Gabbardo The tests for coronavirus will be performed on people who have not traveled abroad or had contact in Brazil with confirmed cases In this situation patients hospitalized in cities with already confirmed cases of coronavirus and who have severe condition ie Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS will be investigated The other situation is the performance of tests for coronavirus in patients with mild flu that is Flu Syndrome seen at Sentinela Networks present in health centers polyclinics and hospitals The priority will also be for cities with already confirmed cases of coronavirus In these health units flu cases are regularly tested by sampling for several viruses and now they will also be tested for coronavirus With these measures we can identify some cases of coronavirus that could go unnoticed by our surveillance The tests will be carried out both in the public health network and in the private one which must follow the protocol of the Ministry of Health said the Health Surveillance Secretary of the Ministry of Health Wanderson de Oliveira The protocol will cover samples collected in the Sentinel Networks distributed in all regions of the country as of March this year retroactively The objective is to identify circulating respiratory viruses monitor the attendance of hospitalized cases and deaths to support decisions and new positions of the Ministry of Health and State and Municipal Health Departments The collection of the sample will also serve to understand the viral profile of the coronavirus This makes it possible to know the seasonality of increased virus circulation transmissibility and behavior in Brazil and thus better organize the national health system This will be the great legacy that the coronavirus will leave for the Brazilian health system as happened with the influenza H pandemic in which provided the world with the development of vaccines and drugs currently used to fight the disease he said the Secretary of Health Surveillance at the Ministry of Health ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
fjhon2u, https www theglobeandmail com canada british columbia article chinas wechat censorship during covid outbreak poses public health China WeChat censorship during COVID outbreak poses public health risk researchers say Andrea Woo and Xiao Xu VANCOUVER Published day ago Updated March One day after group of Chinese doctors took to social media to warn of the emergence of mysterious SARS like virus one of China most popular live streaming platforms quietly added nearly four dozen keywords to its blacklist including Unknown Wuhan pneumonia SARS variation and SARS outbreak in Wuhan The world would soon learn of the novel coronavirus SARS CoV which likely originated in the city of Wuhan and to date has resulted in almost confirmed cases of the resulting illness COVID and deaths globally China has long censored what its citizens can see and say online But new report by researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy shines light on the broad scope of suppressed information about the virus and its public health implications As the coronavirus spreads China is losing its control online Using combination of reverse engineering and automated testing methods researchers looked at WeChat China widely used messaging social media and mobile payment app and YY popular live streaming platform They found that censored materials included government criticism and references to ophthalmologist Li Wenliang who died six weeks after sounding the alarm and whose suppression and mistreatment galvanized the country But the censorship extended to even factual descriptions of the flu like pneumonia and public health messaging on hand washing and the wearing of face masks Such censorship can threaten vital communication related to disease information and prevention the report said What is interesting or what is significant about this case is that this event is more of public health issue rather than just party congress or political events that do not affect wider range of people said Lotus Ruan lead author of the report and research fellow at the Citizen Lab During the study period between Jan and Feb researchers identified keyword combinations on WeChat related to COVID that blocked content They included wide range of topics including discussions of central leaders responses to the outbreak Dr Li and collective action report by the Citizen Lab said WeChat parent company Tencent implements one app two systems model with heavier censorship for Chinese users and less restrictive rules for overseas users However Canadians have observed apparent censorship on the app as well Ou Kehui resident of Richmond C said her account was suspended twice in February after she shared videos from Chinese lawyer and self described citizen journalist Chen Qiushi in group chat Mr Chen had posted videos from Wuhan and has not been seen since Feb Ms Ou added that certain content she shares is often not received by users in China censorship that would often go unnoticed initially According to WeChat website an account could be blocked for several reasons including the user is reported for sending lewd content violent materials scams inappropriate rumours or annoying ads or the user has been reported by other users multiple times Taylor Zhao also Richmond resident last month had his WeChat account suspended mere hours after he had text conversation about an online petition calling on China national legislature to protect citizens right to free speech in the wake of Dr Li death The petition started by Chinese academics and signed by hundreds of Chinese citizens listed five demands of Beijing including that Feb be proclaimed National Freedom of Speech Day Li Wenliang Day Mr Zhao said he suspects the suspension was related to conversation he had with one of those academics Xu Zhangrun who himself had been punished for speaking out against the removal of term limits for President Xi Jinping We live in Canada free land but the app has us bound hand and foot and we do not dare to speak said Mr Zhao Canadian citizen Our freedom is actually restricted We are not living in totally free environment The report concluded that censorship of the COVID outbreak is troubling and shows the need for thorough analysis of the effects of information control during global public health crisis Countering misinformation and uninformed speculation related to the epidemic may help keep public fear in check and remove information that would mislead people about how best to protect themselves the report said However restricting general discussions and factual information has the opposite effect and limits public awareness and response ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
fk9a1de,On mobile so it might be bit messed up but here you go There a moment early in the movie Contagion when health officials lay out what known about the film villain novel virus that is sweeping the globe and leaving dead bodies in its path For many watching in the scene hits little too close to home In front of whiteboard in drab government office health investigator with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention played by Kate Winslet reviews the basics the virus appears to spread through coughing and sneezing The particles released can also land on surfaces such as doorknobs and elevator buttons which then transmit the virus when people touch their faces she says To stop the spread of the pathogen Winslet explains officials need to determine its contagiousness whether people without symptoms can infect others and who exactly is susceptible So far that appears to be everyone with hands mouth and nose quips local health official Nine years after its release Contagion has become the movie du jour as the world grapples with very real disease COVID which has infected more than people in dozens of countries In late January the thriller which also stars Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow rocketed into iTunes top movie rentals chart and became among the most popular films on Amazon Prime and Google Play Though other pandemic movies including Outbreak and Monkeys have also enjoyed renewed favor in recent months none seems to resonate with viewers as much as Contagion That likely because the movie screenwriter Scott Burns conducted months of in depth research into the science of pandemics He then recruited several well established epidemiologists to develop realistic plot edit the script and train the actors who would portray health officials doctors and scientists When started talking to experts they all said It not matter of if there will be another pandemic it a matter of when Burns said There nothing uncanny to me about doing research Amid growing public health crisis the movie near documentary precision has also become source of alarm for some Some fans believe the film fictional destruction and high death toll are signs of what it is to come and suggest that officials are hiding information from the public In the vacuum created by how little is known about this new virus fear and misinformation have flourished The movie prescient as it is predicted that too Burns said Contagion was inspired by his father who often worried about the possibility of avian flu becoming human pandemic Not wanting to make conventional disaster movie Burns turned to Dr Larry Brilliant an epidemiologist who spearheaded the successful global eradication of smallpox At the time around the public seemed to react strangely to the swine flu epidemic Brilliant said People acted almost disappointed that it was not as severe as health officials had warned he said We all started talking about the fact that modernity didn know what real pandemic looked like he said So they set out to create one Contagion tracks the arrival of fictional virus called MEV that sends officials from the CDC and the World Health Organization scrambling to stop the outbreak and quell growing fear and distrust among the public By the end of the film chaos reigns and the disease death toll has reached at least million The fictional virus originates from bat and then jumps to pig and then person which reflects the fact that of new diseases in people come from animals according to the CDC These diseases include HIV Ebola SARS and now COVID In the film knocking down trees in Hong Kong displaces the bat and triggers the emergence of the virus which shows how deforestation and the destruction of animal habitats makes such leaps more likely The virus rapid spread in just hours from Hong Kong to Chicago to Minneapolis reveals the way increasing global travel can quickly turn diseases into pandemics sometimes becoming impossible to contain It was not going to be pure entertainment it was actually going to have some public health messaging said Dr Ian Lipkin Columbia University epidemiology professor who served as the movie main scientific consultant The idea was to make people aware of the fact that emerging diseases will continue to emerge and reemerge Lipkin who has identified hundreds of new diseases throughout his career shared with Burns his experiences from on the frontlines of the SARS outbreak in Beijing Elliott Gould character in the movie UC San Francisco scientist named Ian Sussman is nod to Lipkin Lipkin invited Winslet and actress Jennifer Ehle who plays the researcher developing vaccine for the virus to his lab at Columbia to help them prepare for their roles He developed D model of the virus that rotates on screen He helped Burns during post production to ensure the whooshing and whirring sounds of the fictional labs were accurate In one scene Winslet explains the concept of an naught which refers to how many people each sick person is likely to infect essentially measure of contagiousness The scene brought wonky epidemiology term to the general public much to the delight of public health professors and biology teachers who now play the movie for their classes each year Watching that scene Brilliant said thought d died and gone to heaven Burns said that while filming the movie Damon joked that they needed to amp up its fear factor and add some zombies for it to be real Hollywood thriller But Burns said it had become clear to him and director Steven Soderbergh that the film was even scarier because it was plausible as opposed to creating monster that gives the audience this kind of distance from the story Which brings us to when there is seemingly little distance between Contagion and real life Paltrow who spoiler alert gets killed off in the first minutes of the film recently posted an Instagram selfie from an airplane wearing mask ve already been in this movie she wrote Stay safe Don shake hands Wash hands frequently Paltrow isn the only one drawing these comparisons Many have taken to Twitter to tell people to watch Contagion to figure out what is really going on with COVID commenter wrote on the YouTube page where you can rent the movie for This movie should be FREE due to Coronavirus We must prepare Stephen Tegethoff said that watching Contagion recently with friends made him suspect the virus is going to spread across the globe faster than officials have said Honestly it did make me little paranoid said Tegethoff who lives in Pittsburgh Burns anticipated that pandemic would trigger fear and distrust in government In addition to the scientist characters the movie features freelance journalist played by Jude Law who questions the CDC motives hawks fake cure for the virus and gains fans as people grasp for answers after their loved ones deaths The movie portrayal of panic and scapegoating is what Burns sees as most analogous to what is happening today he said had someone write to me on Instagram and accuse me of being part of the Illuminati and that always knew this was coming Burns said For the most part he said he is gratified that people might glean public health lessons from the movie But his research into the destructive social effects of pandemics makes him worry about widespread fear which led to dips in the stock market countries blaming each other as well as people hoarding masks and other supplies he said What do hope the movie illustrated is how misinformation and fear cause people to behave in ways that frequently are going to make the problem worse or cause new problems Burns said Burns said that making the film showed him how connected people are by public health For example it is the responsibility of those with strong immune systems to not spread diseases to their neighbors who may be more fragile he said In this way he hopes pandemic would bring people together as they realize they need each other to survive an outbreak he said But he knows that is unlikely He made movie about it On the original Contagion poster in red and all caps above the title is the film tagline Nothing spreads like fear

fjk840k,For reference here are two items describing symptoms in detail doctor general description of symptoms for the Covid first three weeks of illness day by day description of symptoms from day through day and treatment for the first patient in the USA He began feeling ill on Jan was admitted to the hospital on Jan th and was released from the hospital Feb rd Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps www straitstimes com asia east asia reporters notebook life and death in wuhan coronavirus icu ve observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about week There are all sorts of mild symptoms feebleness shortness of breath some people have fevers some don Based on studies of our cases the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever per cent of cases feebleness per cent cough per cent muscle pains per cent difficulties breathing while less common symptoms include headaches dizziness stomach pain diarrhea nausea vomiting But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse At this stage people should go to the hospital The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications some may need machine assisted respiration When the body other organs start to fail that when it becomes severe while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes type of white blood cell and see an improvement in their immune systems and have been brought back so to speak But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end experience multiple organ failure and die For most the illness is over in two weeks whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe if they can survive three weeks they re good Those that can will die in three weeks And this Symptom Progression Day to Day From First Case of Novel Coronavirus in the United States year old male https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa On January year old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County Washington with day history of cough and subjective fever On checking into the clinic the patient put on mask in the waiting room After waiting approximately minutes he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by provider He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan China The patient stated that he had seen health alert from the S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and because of his symptoms and recent travel decided to see health care provider Given the patient travel history the local and state health departments were immediately notified Together with the urgent care clinician the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for nCoV on the basis of current CDC persons under investigation case definitions Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens After specimen collection the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department On January the CDC confirmed that the patient nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for nCoV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rRT PCR assay In coordination with CDC subject matter experts state and local health officials emergency medical services and hospital leadership and staff the patient was admitted to an airborne isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact droplet and airborne precautions with eye protection On admission the patient reported persistent dry cough and day history of nausea and vomiting he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain Vital signs were within normal ranges On physical examination the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable After admission the patient received supportive care including liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea On days through of hospitalization days through of illness the patient vital signs remained largely stable apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia Figure The patient continued to report nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued On the afternoon of hospital day the patient passed loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort second episode of loose stool was reported overnight sample of this stool was collected for rRT PCR testing along with additional respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal and serum The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT PCR for nCoV whereas the serum remained negative Treatment during this time was largely supportive For symptom management the patient received as needed antipyretic therapy consisting of mg of acetaminophen every hours and mg of ibuprofen every hours He also received mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately liters of normal saline over the first days of hospitalization chest radiograph taken on hospital day illness day was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities Figure However second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day illness day showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung Figure These radiographic findings coincided with change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day when the patient oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as while he was breathing ambient air On day the patient was started on supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at liters per minute Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital acquired pneumonia treatment with vancomycin mg loading dose followed by administered intravenously every hours and cefepime administered intravenously every hours was initiated On hospital day illness day fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs finding consistent with atypical pneumonia Figure and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation Given the radiographic findings the decision to administer oxygen supplementation the patient ongoing fevers the persistent positive nCoV RNA at multiple sites and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy Treatment with intravenous remdesivir novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development was initiated on the evening of day and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day and cefepime was discontinued on the following day after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus On hospital day illness day the patient clinical condition improved Supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his oxygen saturation values improved to to while he was breathing ambient air The previous bilateral lower lobe rales were no longer present His

fj9knv3,Some good news everyone passes up drug called Remdesivir is entering trials in China and Nebraska https www nih gov news events news releases nih clinical trial remdesivir treat covid begins Remdesivir is an antiviral made by Gilead Science Its VERY effective against coronaviruses in my personal experience My cat is fighting fatal version of the feline coronavirus called FIP feline infectious peritonitis There is no cure for this disease legally speaking have to get the cure for this coronavirus on the black market from of all places China It an antiviral called GS It over effective in cats with no major side effects noted It just hasnt gotten FDA approval because its sister drug Remdesivir shows promise against Ebola and has successfully treated at least person in Washington with no minimal side effects noted in humans It been accelerated into human trials and the link to the NIH site above is about that Gilead doesnt want to approve for veterinary approval because any issues in trials could interfere with human trials and approval Remdesivir is nearly the same as the GS treat my cat with except Remdesivir is basically step shy of GS and is metabolized into active GS in the human body It works by preventing the further replication of the virus Now DO NOT go out and buy GS for COVID Usage and dosage of straight GS in humans is not known Remdesivir is showing to be pretty safe in humans and GS has proven safe in felines but that does not mean they are interchangeable There are multiple research papers on the treatment and dosage for cats but none can find for humans Dr Niels Pedersen of UC Davis authored the papers if you want to read them Plus have to inject my lb kitten daily with ml an equivalent weight dose ratio for the strength of GS would mean ml subcutaneous injection It a very acidic dilutant and injecting that large of volume of anything let alone something with pH of under your skin could cause serious health problems beside the awful pain of the injection My poor kitty cries for good minute after his tiny injection every morning but he has bounced back from near death to pretty good health though he still has weeks of injections ahead of him still Until more data on Remdesivir is available for now the best advice for those worried is to avoid going in public as much as you can Wash your hands often with HOT soapy water Wash before you rub you eyes before you pick booger before you eat before you scratch an itch anywhere in case your fingernail scratches the surface of your skin and wash your hands after all of that as well Washing hands properly and washing often is the thing you can do to prevent the spread of any disease Dont bother with masks as they only work if someone directly point blank coughs in your face once the droplets from cough sneeze dry in the air the bare virus is measured in nanometers and no commercially available mask or respirator can stop particles that small They are waste of your money and prevents the supplies going to the medical professionals who do need them as working directly with sick patients in the hospital means they can easily get point blank cough sneeze in the face but more importantly it helps keep them from spreading any other diseases to sick patients making their condition worse fighting multiple illnesses ,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

fi4mtsy,Included below are items doctor general description of symptoms for the first three weeks of illness day by day description of symptoms from day through day and treatment for the first patient in the USA He began feeling ill on Jan was admitted to the hospital on Jan th and was released from the hospital Feb rd Item Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps www straitstimes com asia east asia reporters notebook life and death in wuhan coronavirus icu ve observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about week There are all sorts of mild symptoms feebleness shortness of breath some people have fevers some don Based on studies of our cases the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever per cent of cases feebleness per cent cough per cent muscle pains per cent difficulties breathing while less common symptoms include headaches dizziness stomach pain diarrhea nausea vomiting But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse At this stage people should go to the hospital The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications some may need machine assisted respiration When the body other organs start to fail that when it becomes severe while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes type of white blood cell and see an improvement in their immune systems and have been brought back so to speak But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end experience multiple organ failure and die For most the illness is over in two weeks whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe if they can survive three weeks they re good Those that can will die in three weeks Item Symptom Progression Day to Day From First Case of Novel Coronavirus in the United States year old male https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa On January year old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County Washington with day history of cough and subjective fever On checking into the clinic the patient put on mask in the waiting room After waiting approximately minutes he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by provider He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan China The patient stated that he had seen health alert from the S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and because of his symptoms and recent travel decided to see health care provider Given the patient travel history the local and state health departments were immediately notified Together with the urgent care clinician the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for nCoV on the basis of current CDC persons under investigation case definitions Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens After specimen collection the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department On January the CDC confirmed that the patient nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for nCoV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rRT PCR assay In coordination with CDC subject matter experts state and local health officials emergency medical services and hospital leadership and staff the patient was admitted to an airborne isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact droplet and airborne precautions with eye protection On admission the patient reported persistent dry cough and day history of nausea and vomiting he

examination was generally unremarkable After admission the patient received supportive care including liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea On days through of hospitalization days through of illness the patient vital signs remained largely stable apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia Figure The patient continued to report nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued On the afternoon of hospital day the patient passed loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort second episode of loose stool was reported overnight sample of this stool was collected for rRT PCR testing along with additional respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal and serum The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT PCR for nCoV whereas the serum remained negative Treatment during this time was largely supportive For symptom management the patient received as needed antipyretic therapy consisting of mg of acetaminophen every hours and mg of ibuprofen every hours He also received mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately liters of normal saline over the first days of hospitalization chest radiograph taken on hospital day illness day was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities Figure However second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day illness day showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung Figure These radiographic findings coincided with change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day when the patient oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as while he was breathing ambient air On day the patient was started on supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at liters per minute Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital acquired pneumonia treatment with vancomycin mg loading dose followed by administered intravenously every hours and cefepime administered intravenously every hours was initiated On hospital day illness day fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs finding consistent with atypical pneumonia Figure and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation Given the radiographic findings the decision to administer oxygen supplementation the patient ongoing fevers the persistent positive nCoV RNA at multiple sites and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy Treatment with intravenous remdesivir novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development was initiated on the evening of day and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day and cefepime was discontinued on the following day after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus On hospital day illness day the patient clinical condition improved Supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his oxygen saturation values improved to to while he was breathing ambient air The previous bilateral lower lobe rales were no longer present His appetite improved and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea As of January the patient remains hospitalized He is afebrile and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough which is decreasing in severity The above

fellow scientists at the World Health Organization headquarters for an urgent meeting to piece together like giant jigsaw puzzle our findings so far We need to get clear view of the contagion and plug the holes in our understanding of the disease to inform public health decisions that affect hundreds of millions of lives Science has critical role to play in restoring calm Let start with what we know The new coronavirus is close cousin of viruses that infect bats It jumped from an unconfirmed wild source most likely bats to an intermediate host possibly pangolins or other small mammals being sold as food at market in Wuhan transport and commercial hub in central China The infected people unknowingly spread it to others setting off the outbreak deadly journey We now estimate that it takes about five to six days possibly upward of days for someone to show symptoms from when they become infected What do we most need to know next For epidemiologists who track infectious diseases the most pressing concerns are how to estimate the lethality of the disease and who is susceptible getting detailed information on how it spreads and evaluating the success of control measures so far No is the clinical iceberg question How much of it is hidden below the surface Because the outbreak is evolving in real time we can yet see the totality of those infected Out of view is some proportion of mildly infected people with minor symptoms or no symptoms who no one knows are infected fleet of invisible carriers sounds ominous but in fact an enormous hidden figure would mean many fewer of the infected are dying Usually simple math would determine this case fatality ratio divide the total number of deaths by the total number of people infected In an emerging epidemic however both numbers keep changing and sometimes at different speeds This makes simple division impossible you will invariably get it wrong In during the early days of the SARS outbreak the medical community got the math wrong At first we believed that case fatality hovered between percent and percent It took two pages of longhand algebra written in Oxford England coded into computer in London and then applied to data from Hong Kong to get it right The actual case fatality for Hong Kong was staggering percent That not to suggest we re facing as dire scenario now Several groups including mine are each using our own methods to calculate preliminary estimate of the new virus lethality If there near agreement among our findings expected within the week we ll be more confident in describing the new coronavirus Does it resemble the seasonal flu SARS or one of the largest plagues in human history the Spanish flu pandemic Knowing the number of people likely to die or who get seriously sick or have zero symptoms will help health authorities determine the strength of response required They can better estimate how many isolation beds heart lung machines and medicines among other things are needed Last month to start understanding the severity of this illness my team assisted Chinese experts in analyzing the initial confirmed cases of infection We learned that percent of people had neither visited market nor been exposed to another person showing pneumonialike symptoms which implied among other things the possibility that some infected people don suffer from obvious symptoms meaning the illness isn always severe Along with getting grasp on the level of severity is figuring out susceptibility or who is most at risk for infection The data so far indicates that this would include older adults the obese and people with underlying medical conditions There are few reports of children becoming infected But are they not showing symptoms or are they immune And could they infect others as silent carriers We must study those under to find out the answers could help us fine tune public health measures For example should schools in China and Hong Kong remain closed Returning to the big picture we must also refine what we know about how the new coronavirus is passed between people Even as the outbreak appears to keep escalating we believe the rapid sometimes necessarily draconian response of governments and health authorities has made dent in transmission In another recent study we estimated how many people could get infected if there were no drastic public health interventions Our goal with this report was to sound the alarm over what could be so that it wouldn be Scientists are working toward quantifying effectiveness of the response We need to find out if the virus basic reproductive number the or naught has dropped While our earliest estimates showed that typically every person infected by the new coronavirus passes it to to others it still too early to know if measures have reduced the number to below the critical threshold of Simultaneously we re closely watching the rest of the world for any large sustained outbreaks that might resemble ground zero in Wuhan We expect more clarity within days or weeks As of Monday the largest concentration of infected patients in single location outside mainland China at more than people is on cruise ship the Diamond Princess quarantined at Japan Yokohama port Finally scientists need to appraise the control or social distancing measures deployed since the outbreak began The challenge involves trying to quantify how many infections were actually prevented through measures such as wearing masks closing schools and locking down cities One possible approach to this assessment in China could involve using location services data from cellphones As we determine research priorities at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva this week the hope is that the science being urgently coordinated will also fight the crisis on other fronts It could help battle the emerging infodemic the cacophony of real news fake news and pseudoscience that feeds uncertainty and breeds panic And it could help roll back some measures seemingly fueled by populism and nativism The travel advisories outright travel bans immigration controls and xenophobic treatment of people from different places are doing significant harm The goal is to stay at least couple of steps ahead of the epidemic curve Scientists must prepare health authorities to catch any subsequent waves of infections and prepare for the possibility that this particular virus could reappear seasonally and maybe one day it could be only as bad as the common cold ve seen record breaking outbreaks before and witnessed the world rally If everyone plays their role and remains on guard then chances are we will defeat the new coronavirus too This is the best way to honor Dr Li Wenliang one of the first doctors in Wuhan to warn the world about the disease the very one that killed him last week at age ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0
fjopnrl, Open letter to the Belgian Prime Minister and to my fellow citizens part Dear Prime Minister dear fellow citizens Belgium has experienced many political crises it is local specialty for which we are famous in the world but it is facing today its first real crisis since the Second World War and it turns out to be very badly prepared to respond to it effectively The attitude of the Ministry of Public Health is paternalistic with the message we are prepared we have pandemic plan we have groups of experts we are monitoring the situation closely we are controlling the situation we are communicating as it is necessary and we are not interested in independent criticism of health professionals or scientists However apart from the disinterest in the opinion of professionals independent of the government nothing could be further from the truth we are not prepared we do not have pandemic plan government experts demonstrate lack of knowledge of this new coronavirus characteristics they follow the situation closely but refuse to anticipate it and communication remains incoherent for the simple reason that they do not sufficiently understand the nature of the danger we face Belgium does not have pandemic plan This information will probably even surprise the Minister of Health but Belgium does not in fact have pandemic plan Instead of having one Belgium has an epidemic plan and there is crucial difference between the two Contrary to epidemics where the foci of infections remain localized in certain regions of the globe as was the case for both SARS and MERS in pandemic these foci continue to spread uncontrollably in most countries The consequence of this difference is logistical problem the supply chains of materials necessary for health care are interrupted For this reason true pandemic plan is based on the concept of strategic reserve all the material necessary not only to ensure the normal functioning of our health care system but also to have the capacity to absorb the inevitable increase in the number of patients to be treated must be kept in stock in sufficient quantity if it is not produced on Belgian territory We are already in shortage of masks so Belgium does not have pandemic plan Contrary to the assertions of the Minister of Health we are therefore not prepared and it is urgent that the government takes all the measures necessary to remedy this deficiency Confronting the reality of the situation Those who do not have the professional skills to judge the situation for themselves are reduced to trying to determine which expert is closest to the reality of the situation an exercise in futility believe on the contrary that it is possible to explain the reality of the situation in an intelligible way to the government and to the general public but that requires everyone to make little effort to understand the two most important figures in epidemiology from public health perspective Once this information is understood everyone will be in position to assess the proportionality of the public health measures that have been taken and that remain to be taken What are the conditions that favor the emergence of pandemic new contagious virus for which the population has no immunity The more contagious the virus the greater the difficulty in containing it the greater the risk of pandemic The flow of people and goods in the modern world as well as the concentration of the population in urban areas increase the pandemic potential of emerging viruses Public health measures to counter the spread of the virus The spread of virus is closely linked to the frequency of contact between individuals the more contact there is the more the probability of transmission increases And so the essence of public health measures for pandemic virus is to reduce the frequency of contact between individuals as much as possible it is no secret Can we contain the spread of virus with pandemic potential Yes if the required public health measures are implemented without delay Hong Kong Singapore and Japan countries that have much closer contacts with China have been able to stem the spread of the virus in their country They were exposed to the SARS epidemic in and their public health officials learned the right lessons They were ready and that proves that it is possible to have an effective response to pandemic Containing pandemic virus is race against time On the starting line we have new virus and public health systems around the world The virus starts first but slowly and it is up to health systems to respond without delay as the virus spreads faster by the day The virus respects neither borders nor schedules and it does not take break during the carnival holidays The Minister of Health assures us that we are weeks behind Italy We are days behind Italy Every day counts Usual dangers and unusual dangers People are generally well prepared for the dangers they face regularly because these dangers correspond to their usual experience No one is psychologically prepared for pandemic the last one took place little over years ago and therefore no one has personal experience of pandemic it is very difficult for people to anticipate the explosive nature of the spread of an infectious agent even though it is well established scientifically that virus spreads exponentially Exponential multiplication Apart from financiers engineers and scientists the properties of the exponential function remain very abstract for members of government and the general public and will try to make them more concrete We are all very familiar with the functions of addition and multiplication because we use them daily The exponential function is series of multiplication and our intuition is less developed on the implications of series multiplication because there are few phenomena around us that flagrantly follow this function To make it clear what is going on in pandemic would like to make the connection with two exponential phenomena with which most people are familiar The compound interest loan and the stick of dynamite stick of dynamite and compound interest are two exponential phenomena with which we are familiar What happens when dynamite explodes One molecule of TNT reacts and makes other molecules react fraction of second later and that is molecules in turn make each other molecules react the same fraction of second later and this million molecules which react produce billion then trillion etc every fraction of second until all the TNT has reacted in less than second Result BOOM the stick exploded At the other end of the speed spectrum you can take compound interest Consider buying loan funded home with an annual interest rate of You may think is not much but if you do the math on year contract you end up paying as much in interest as the price of the house And that the power of the exponential function it goes up quickly with an annual rate of we pay more than times the price of the house in interest The predatory and amoral character of our financial system is debate for another day but is an important factor in the systemic precariousness of modern society which can only be exposed by the developing crisis pandemic is halfway between compound interest loan and stick of dynamite The three phenomena are explosive but at different time scales of the order of the week year and millisecond To be continued,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

fjsa9xw,Good read Posted in here about month ago when we were in limbo after being turned away from different countries due to having been to Hong Kong We went back and forth around South East Asia for week before we were finally allowed to refuel and take on supplies in Thailand The whole trip was shambles with most ports cancelled and the plan changing by the hour We finally docked in Singapore on the th of Feb and all cruises since have been cancelled All guests got off in Singapore and then we sailed to shipyard in the North and stayed there for days doing some repairs whilst the head office figured out what the fuck we should do We should have had another month or so sailing around South East Asia but they scrapped that idea for obvious reasons Currently we are very very very slowly inching towards Sri Lanka with only the crew on board Deliberately taking days at sea to get there so we have effectively quarantined the ship so that if everyone is fit and healthy when we arrive then we can assume the ship is corona free Doesn seem like great plan to me but that what they are going with We got told yesterday that no crew will be allowed to disembark in Sri Lanka and no shore leave is allowed And yet guests are apparently fine to fly in from all over the world and embark good crew should have gone home weeks ago but haven been allowed to leave They were told they could leave and go home in Sri Lanka but now that isn happening After that we go to India and they can leave there either Next port allowing people to go home is in Oman on the th so obviously people are getting very pissed off being forced to stay on board weeks after their contracts should have ended On the plus side the whole ship is now free to use for the crew All the passenger pools bars restaurants etc And with no passengers on board loads of people are basically on holiday as their jobs are entirely guest related Loads of parties and bbq etc to keep people from going stir crazy Unfortunately m an engineer and having no passengers makes fuck all difference to us so we haven really been able to enjoy any of it sulk Apparently we have people booked onto join the next cruise starting in Colombo after they massively discounted it Capacity is ish passengers But with the latest about this Princess ship and the virus being headline news every day am expecting lot of those won actually show up to join ve still got weeks to go so hopefully by then things will be bit more organised At the moment nobody seems to have clue what is happening from one day to the next On the bright side if the whole world goes to shit maybe at sea will be the only safe place to be quite like the idea of re populating the Earth ,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fivgaga,Much like any manufacturing process not everything that is created is wildly successful m sure at the Wuhan lab they are working on all kinds of viruses with all different and CFR characteristics some are scary deadly and some won even get you sick COVID is somewhere in between The Chinese started attacking this virus aggressively from the very beginning way before anyone could have know it was circulating November December that because it didn happen naturally and ll explain why m right Most likely what happened is that during development and testing someone at the Wuhan lab violated protocol and didn tell anyone They got infected got sick nd they spread it outside the lab The reason think this was lab protocol violation release is because China was on this right away back in early November other than knowing that lab protocol was breached there was no way for the Chinese to know that new virus was circulating at least back in November COVID presents as the flu and just like the flu it can escalate into pneumonia which is what is killing people Without test you don know if someone has the flu or has COVID If there was huge spike in flu cases and deaths like or times normal then the Chinese authorities would have known something was up but that didn happen even when you consider that the Chinese were lying about the number of cases deaths they weren or times normal and certainly not back in November December January So how could the Chinese know about new virus making the rounds back in November if the there wasn an explosion of cases in order to get their attention They knew because it didn happen naturally that how they knew After the person who broke protocol got sick he admitted what happened and then the Chinese government pounced on it immediately ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fjony9x,The article has more explanations for why COVID is different from SARS in addition to asymptomatic transmission for COVID third explanation could be that the transmissibility might be higher for COVID than for SARS is central concept in infectious disease epidemiology indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to its epidemic potential recent review published in February found the average of COVID to be and median to be higher than that of SARS although more accurate estimates can only be ascertained when the epidemic stablises The speed of spread of COVID from the first documented case in early December to cases by the end of February despite massive containment efforts is certainly much faster than that reported for SARS between November and March before any forms of containment were even instituted The high attack rates on the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan with more than on board infected out of approximately cruise ship passengers and crew members by Feb despite public health measures suggest very high transmissibility fourth explanation is that the clinical spectrum is different China initial case definition was focused on pneumonia and initial case fatality rates CFR were reported at about on the basis of this narrow case definition However as the epidemic unfolds it has become apparent that mild cases are common in COVID Patients with mild disease manifestations will be missed even if more sensitive surveillance system were in place and these patients might spread the disease silently similar to influenza On Feb the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published their data of the first patients including patients with confirmed COVID As many as of the patients with confirmed COVID were reported to have mild disease or less severe forms of pneumonia whereas had severe condition and were critically ill The study also noted that nearly half of the critically ill patients have died Of the patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship which provides captive cohort to study the virus more than were asymptomatic upon diagnosis Estimating CFRs remains elusive as many patients are still in the early stages of disease and more fatalities could occur given that death seems to occur weeks after onset of symptoms The current estimate by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is CFR of with increasing CFRs for patients with advanced age or comorbidities However the report also shows that CFRs vary greatly between Wuhan and other provinces in China therefore some uncertainty remains around CFRs With already more than cases imported into or acquired in other countries or on cruise ships more information on the full spectrum of disease and better estimate of the CFR should be available in the next few weeks Of note is that even if the CFR of COVID possibly lt is far lower than that of SARS this is not reassuring as highly transmissible disease with low CFR will result in many more cases and therefore also ultimately more deaths than SARS fifth explanation is that community spread is more prominent Whereas SARS was mainly an outbreak propagated within hospitals widespread community transmission is already evident for COVID By Feb more than cases had been reported Some models indicate that several hundred thousand infections might already exist in China Consequently there will be more unknown contacts than known contacts in the community which means that many contacts who will subsequently develop an infection are not quarantined and under proper medical observation Hence China decided to enforce the most drastic of all classic public health measures community containment with social distancing community use of facemasks and lockdown of Wuhan public transportation including buses trains ferries and airport As the community based outbreak spread the lockdown was extended to more than million residents in more than cities by Jan China has essentially issued the largest quarantine in history to prevent its spread to the rest of the world By Jan close contacts have been tracked and total of people were receiving medical observation This approach is an unprecedented gigantic effort that surpasses all efforts done during SARS What is already known is that exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large scale outbreaks if the countries have the political will to rapidly implement early case detection prompt isolation of ill people comprehensive contact tracing and immediate quarantine of all contacts If this approach is not feasible because of widespread community transmission then community quarantine is also needed with rigorous implementation of social distancing ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
fklu8n7,Let me start off by apologizing for this long winded response there is lot to unpack believe you re missing the point and value of these comments Panic mode is not terrible because it has the propensity to make people vigilant We all come to reach panic point when faced with adversity it a psychological and physiological condition innate in all of us in order to avoid danger Just as panic is byproduct of fear so is denial Panic at least has goal to protect ourselves our loved ones and our society Denial on the other hand is dangerous because it provides no means of resolve it a stagnant condition perpetuated by itself and only serves the sufferer by providing coping mechanism which inevitably leads to lack of situational comprehension and awareness Ironically panic is means to denial end as people usually need sudden jolt to snap out of it The facts remain perfectly healthy young people can have serious complications requiring weeks of hospitalization and patients may develop sequelae after suffering from serious illness caused by SARS CoV because this is common feature of pneumonia and ARDS Source https jamanetwork com journals jama article abstract Source https www medscape com answers what are the complications of viral pneumonia Source https www patientcareonline com journal respiratory diseases understanding and improving long term sequelae ards Right now Italian doctors are having to make tough calls choosing to give younger people life saving oxygen over older people because there is limited amount of machines and younger people have greater chance of surviving after they receive the treatment although this is not guaranteed There are plenty of otherwise healthy young people on supplemental oxygen and ventilation in Italy right now fighting for their lives If this was not true this choice would not need to be made Source https www theatlantic com ideas archive who gets hospital bed Source https www nytimes com world europe italy coronavirus health care html Source https nymag com intelligencer coronavirus and its high mortality rate among older patients html The point of Dr Fauci comment and many others on here is that younger people need to be just as vigilant as older people when it comes to their health Not only could they potentially be saving their own lives but they are giving older people fighting chance whether it be by not infecting them or by not directly competing with them in hospital As year old healthy person if end up in the hospital and require oxygen there is no doubt in my mind am going to feel guilty as hell probably for the rest of my life Guilt for not protecting myself better so to not potentially take oxygen away from someone else only became aware of the totality of this situation because didn shut myself off to the alarming and seemingly panic driven news coming out of Italy In turn it provided me with yet another reason to be more prudent and not act selfishly Dr Fauci decidedly made these sobering yet diplomatic comments because he believes some young people are not aware The people on here go step further to articulate their understanding as to the reason why this needs to be said some younger people haven undergone the critical self preservation panic stage because they do not feel like they are directly affected because they are unaware of certain facts selfish or in denial think this is legitimate assessment They then go on to inform us on why young people should be concerned Awareness no matter how people receive it come to accept it or decidedly share it is never bad thing especially if it can help alter selfish behaviors that would have otherwise continued Unlike people experiencing denial vigilant people or people that were once panicked are by virtue of the condition more aware of their surroundings Yes some act selfishly ie toilet paper hoarders but good majority of us critical thinkers do not Typically the hoarding sort reach the panic stage little too late and all at the same time and they hoard because everyone else is hoarding ie they became situationally aware and panic drive panic Good news panic wains for most and they still have time to be vigilant prepared and think about others before this virus hits with full force It just so happens that this sub is filled with panic posts because we all reach the post panic acceptance stage at different points Panic post are no less valuable than any other as long as they are filled with facts and the one you responded to was not incorrect Most importantly fear driven panic is better than selfish denial especially when other people behaviors can directly affect another health It best if some are scared into accepting this situation opposed to galavanting in complete disregard Keeping in mind that those toilet paper people obviously plan to stay home so that is good and better than the alternative However gaslighting others with blatant criticisms and varying levels of denial via barrage of rhetorical questions is detrimental You said you need facts but said nothing of value If you need facts well then go get em plenty are there and feel free to share your findings If they contradict someone then perfect you have proven your point while also contributing to everyone overall awareness of the situation We all should panic at one point at least to some degree because it means we re not numb idiot assholes Hopefully more panic now to get it over with rather than later as prudence vigilance and care can most certainly result and all are desperately needed now so we can all beat this thing m happy to see that the flu comparisons have wained so this is good sign we are moving in the right direction ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

fh84j9g,The coronavirus is bioweapon that the US used against China to cripple their economy The short term goal is we ve been trying to get China to back down in the trade war for long time now but so far we ve been unsuccessful It a game of brinkmanship and we can hold on any longer because the US economy is about to crash We released the virus because the US must not lose the trade war and have it be announced to the world that we lost by our economy crashing harder than the Great Recession So we sabotaged them by another means Our economy is about to crash because we ve been artificially propping it up to create the illusion that the trade war isn hurting us The US appears prosperous with low unemployment the stock market at record highs and going ten years without recession But it an illusion that we re presenting to China to bluff them into thinking that the trade war isn hurting us The truth is that we ve been engaged in massive government spending and the fed has started up quantitative easing again to stimulate the economy It why our budget deficit is at trillion which hasn been that high since when we were in the Great Recession and using quantitative easing to lift us out of it It also why we ve gone for years without recession which is record We postponed it by sheer spending As result we ve created dangerous bubble that is about to burst Our seemingly prosperous economy is fake We tried to bluff China Trump likes to bluff They called our bluff Meanwhile Trump bubble is about to burst So we Tonya Harding ed them America long term goal is we fear their rise and we wish to prevent China from becoming superpower through pre emptive war This interesting document https pastebin com KC CH has been going around ,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fhobyeb,I not an expert at all but ll just throw out few things to speculate about It a new virus to us but we are also new host to them Coronaviruses are RNA viruses and mutate lot in real time as they infect host Because we are new to the virus they have both pressure and room for improvement to adapt which means lots of internally competing strains in race https www scmp com news china science article striking coronavirus mutations found within one family cluster to establish themselves in any one host as their first order of business Right now the incubation is long because the existing strains are not adapted to humans If this is correct the incubation period will become shorter as time goes on But shorter incubation is disadvantages them against other stealthier slower and deadlier strains that take longer to incubate and thus the speedy short incubation period strains have comparatively less time to spread themselves to other hosts To compensate the faster winning strains will evolve to be less likely to disable or kill the host thus allowing the host human to continue their social life thus infecting more people IOW it buys potentially much more time to spread by being mild than it lost in the incubation period It a trade off Proof of concept Other coronaviruses others believe that are already endemic settle into pattern or equilibrium that more consistently produces mild illness like the common cold This is hopefully just another coronavirus that will eventually conform to the same strategy This may be why large scale quarantines may not be the best strategy against coronaviruses They mutate quickly and by allowing active people with no symptoms or mild symptoms to move about more freely it will give those mild strains chance to take hold elsewhere This may serve as natural vaccine against the more virulent dangerous strains Quarantines also concentrate more sickness into one area thus leading to overwhelmed local health systems especially in densely populated area like Hubei The one good thing can think of is that large quarantines buy little time to prepare As gamble would accept the trade off of long term natural inoculation vs short term contingencies don know how long it would take for this virus to evolve completely into milder form but quarantines may actually slow down that natural process ve seen an estimate from experts that as many as million people gt the current clinical and tested cases in China with most in Hubei may already be infected but the vast majority are showing very mild or no symptoms That may mean that there are many mild strains already out there waiting to act as rough vaccine if they are simply allowed to spread There are lots of unknowns about this and m really just some guy on the internet can say you shouldn worry at all there are actual deadly strains out there and people may panic while disrupting the world economy but since ve been reading up on other milder coronaviruses how they mutate and adapt with similar strategies as the common cold found that encouraging Not all of them are harmless SARS and MERS are pretty lethal but those don spread nearly as easily so those exceptions prove the rule ,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
fi0vip7,Transcript from another Redditor for those of you who have been banned from coronavirus Transcript fixed mat references thanks honeight Hello my name is professor Kentaro Iwata am specialist of infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital Kobe Japan Today entered into the cruise ship Diamond Princess which is bombarded by lot of COVID infection right now and was removed from the ship on the same day and m going to talk to you why this happened was very concerned of the number of the people who got infected with COVID disease infections Then was wondering why this is happening wanted to enter into the cruise ship and wanted to be useful in helping to containing infection there spoke with several people and finally the one officer at working for Ministry of Health and Labor called me yesterday saying that well you can come and enter into cruise ship and do the infection control work and said fine then prepared my stuff and did all the paperwork and arrangement and they got in onto the Shinkansen from Kobe to Yokohama all the way to go to Yokohama got another call from the same officer say that somebody didn like me so do you can get into the cruise ship He was not able to say who and he was not able to say why but certainly some power over him affected his decision and was blocked from entering into the ship then after several discussions he found another way that if you could come as DMAT team member you can come in at into the cruise ship DMAT is the disaster management medical team in Japan and usually deals with disaster not infectious diseases but because of the lack of the people who could help people inside cruise ship to get out of the ship or the managing of people and the swan song DMAT was requested to enter in the cruise ship because my specialty is not disaster management So was not very happy about that but because we have no other way said fine ll do that Additionally got another call that some people didn like me getting into the cruise ship present even as DMAT member Another discussion happened then the waited about our one hour in shin yokohama sessions and finally the officer find way that if you work for DMAT not as an infection prevention specialist but as the ordinary routine Diamond officer working under wounded team at doctor doing routine job then you could come into the cruise ship was not very happy with that decision but because there no other way so said finding out get into the ship entered the ship then found the chief officer of the DMAT and spoke with him said well was assigned to the DMAT members or the out whatever you want to say they hes well you don have to work team DMAT work because that not your specialty and you are an infection prevention specialist so why don you do the infection control then said fine spoke with the superior of him who is in charge of the DMAT operations and he also said that you are infection control person so you should do infection control said fine but he said well you shouldn be here as DMAT member you should come as the along to infection control specialist he was not very happy about while was inside DMAT but because that was not my decision there was no other way so he said well have to do it looked into the several places inside the ship and the turned out that the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of the infection control there was no distinction between the Green Zone which is the free of infection and the Red Zone which is potentially contaminated by virus So the people could come and go wearing PPE of PPE crews were just walking around and the officers of ministry the health and the labor was walking around DMAT people are walking around psychiatrists are walking around and people were eating on the one players people were wearing PPE and off PPE and eating lunch with their gloves on and just dealing with the smart phone with full PPE so it was completely chaotic and some crews had fever they went to the medical center while wearing and masks but he didn have any protection between his room and medical room and the medical officer was not protecting herself and that she was very happy saying that well she was already infected m sure about that so the she was completely giving up protecting herself anyways dealt with lots of infections more than twenty years and was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak was in another country is dealing with the cholera outbreak was in China in to deal with the SARS and saw many febrile patient there never had fear of getting infection myself for Ebola SARS cholera because know how to protect myself and how to protect others and how the infection control should be So could do the adequate infection control protect myself and protect others but inside Princess Diamond was so scared was so scared of getting COVID because there was no way to tell where the virus is No green zone no red zone everywhere could have Virus and everybody was not careful about it There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and that there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as professional The bureaucrats were in charge of everything and spoke with the head officer of the Ministry of Health on labor and he was very happy with my suggestion of protecting DMAT people and other staffs so that no other secondary transmission to occur then after several hours of talking to people and finding problems found lot of issues there for example informed consent of getting PCR from the people in the ship was on paper and that paper was going back and forth back and forth with the room of the infection from the paper by touching there So suggested that maybe it better to abandon the paper type informed consent but resolutely getting the informed consent probably would be more protective so on so on so yeah I think was reasonable and never yell at anybody and never criticize anybody personally but was trying to be constructive but we try to seek the constructive but immediate improvement to protect everybody inside the ship Then about five clock the person from the quarantine office came in and approached said well you have to be out because you will not be allowed to inside of ship because was inside ship as the temporary officer of the quarantine that he apparently my my rank was removed by somebody and then nobody said who that the was out And the officer who offered me the job of infection control said he was sorry then asked him so what do you want to do then do you want to infect everybody in the ship it will be your thousands of people who could potentially get COVID don criticize DMAT people they were not infection control specialists Society of infection prevention entered the lot of specialists came in but they spend only few days and to left And they said they were fearful of getting infections themselves share the same fear because m in the same room now and separated from my family m very scared of getting infection myself and m very scared of infecting my family too ll be out of my medical services at Culver University Hospital for maybe next two weeks to avoid further infections to occur that is very likely to occur if you keep zero infection control inside the ship that brings us like this You might know that there is no CDC in Japan but thought there must be some specialists called on and was in charge of infection control in ship it not expecting nobody was professional infection control specialist and the only the bureaucrats were doing the jobs completely layman work in the violating all the infection control principles and the risking people inside further infections so m not very surprised to see many new positive PCR to be broadcasted every day hundreds of people got infected and the lot of people from outside Japan decided to take the people away from the ship and bring them to their home countries by airplane and offered them another days of quarantine hope this will be the opportunity to raise question what is happening inside ship wish all the international bodies to request Japan to change wish everybody to call for protection of people inside the Diamond Princess Otherwise there will be far more infections for passengers for crews for Diamond members for psychiatrist for officer of the Ministry of Health and labor DMAT member consists of nurses and doctors and that they will go back to the hospital they work routinely and it a much infected their patients further to spread and the disease can bear with it can bear with it think we have to change we have to do something about these crews and we have to help people inside the ship their safety and their life Again am professor Kentaro Iwata of infection this infectious disease specialist thank you for listening Edit Thank you to honeight for the DMAT definition confirmation Thank you to others for confirming the professors position If there are other glaring inaccuracies in here please send me message and ll update have not seen the WHO any wire service or any media coverage about how infection management has been covered on the Diamond Princess so view this thread and source as authoritative at the moment until proven otherwise ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

fks0n1r,No they were still testing If there was blanket order then how did people got tested One lab did whole sequencing and find it to be different from SARS About similar but different Another did partial sequencing and just reported it as SARS One was in Guangzhou another Beijing Li posted on social media after these results After thoes results they made the statement to let only the certified lab test The article made it sound like there were ten labs who all got these alarming results and freakedout then got silenced by evil CCP which just no It wasn ten labs just the two above then the appointed lab You can say they stopped people from testing Then say there were eight test results after they stopped people from testing No one was hiding anything Just because you didn heard about it in the western media doesn mean it was hidden It was on Chinese national television and trending on social media since December millions of people in China knew it The WHO was notified and they too released report in December but hay they are obviously CCP puppet so let ignore them too People in the West never cared about it until it hit Italy guess the rest of the world just doesn matter heard it repeat again and again that China was hiding When When were they hiding In December And they were not going to stamped it quickly It sneaker and more contagious than flu They didn know that Local CDC used SARS protocol but the long incubation time and mild cases fucked them up Back then they didn have rt PCR kits and whole genome sequencing takes days instead of hours There were no way they coud do what SK did back then Also they use Suggest they have highly infectious virus in the article to imply they should act more harshly But how contagiou and how deadly was the virus It could be anything from flu to MARS Just today some British scientist was arguing it real mortality is just like the flu The local CDC can shut everything down during Chinese new year none the less for virus that appear to be mild and killed nobody WHAT DONT LIKE ABOUT THE CCP is that they are ultimately populous government don think what Li did spreading rumors on social media about patientzs confidential lab result was heroic but once people made him symbol the government just made him recognized national hero And the CCP also throw the local government under the bus to make people happy even if they were following normal pandemic protocol going through steps to develop kits and evaluating CFR Yes the virus spread yes people died but it wasn even NORMAL thing to try containing flu like disease The WHO officers thought China was crazy when we wanted to try the normal thing to do is let it spread like N and just say too bad Herd immunity for everyone That why the WHO officials were so skeptical at first and completely turnes around after visiting China they saw that quarantine worked Oh and whatever China did no way it would be seen as even slightly positive They didn hide anything they did exactly what you said and you see how the anti sino media spined this whole thing hero lone soldier am LOLing here When we did lockdown it was tyranny total violation of human rights ruining people life Fake video from years ago was upload on YouTube with titles like Evil army in Wuhan Centralize care center were called concentration camps when people were getting free treatment and can call home from there whenever they want People on Raddit insisting millions were killed by secret police or that everyone in Wuhan died ve had someone who is Trump voter calling me Nazis and claiming more people were killed in Wuhan than Jews killed in Germany Even if the logistics make no sense They are screaming make China pay on Twitter and they didn mean with money Just today saw badly Photoshop picture of Chinese street where they manipulated giant picture of Xi on the wall like cult leader The lighting was way off and you can see the Photoshop artifact from mile away And here people are commenting oh look China look just like dictatorship from what they saw on pop media We can do whatever we want to them in the name of Justice Everyone is saying China didn do anything and just let this virus spread Yeah but why you think every countryis month behind China on the time line when they are just hr flight away Could it be we lockeddown half the country and bought people time which they totaly just wasted Except SK You know who was that tragic hero Protecing everyone else by locking down Italy Italy who could have done it the way SK did but act way too late haven heard single bad thing about Italy this week Nobody said the Italian government should be on trail for crime against humanity Suddenly every Western country is putting themselves in their shose and sympathetic And America still hasn start mass testing Trump said it just the flu But they re not hiding anything like the real number it an honest mistake no one is responsible for it and it doesn

fjj6oni,So your contention is that the much lower numbers of deaths in other european countries compared to Italy are due to large number of deaths not being detected as corona cases in those countries rather than larger number of infections in Italy And your only evidence is one death in Spain that was not recognised as corona case at point when the number of confirmed cases in Spain was both tourists that very likely didn get infected in Spain The only death count you seem to consider reasonably accurate is the Italian one everyone else must have missed dozens of deaths if you re to be believed and the one lucky exception to that absurd overextrapolation on your part is Italy for some reason This doesn just apply to european countries where most of the outbreaks are probably not as far along as in Italy you could also take South Korea for comparison The outbreak there clearly started before the one in Italy but their reported death count stands at only from confirmed cases Italy is only reporting half the confirmed cases but times the number of deaths If both countries have managed to detect similar proportion of the total number of infections the Italian health system must be failing quite hard compared to the South Korean one If both health systems are performing comparibly the detection rate must be much lower in Italy Another point of comparison could be Germany though the numbers are still too small to draw reliable conclusions from where the outbreak started at the same time and unrelated to the Italian outbreak Germany still hasn recorded single Death as of yesterday with confirmed cases Either Germany has done very well detecting and isolating cases early compared to Italy or German doctors are performing miracles keeping severe cases alive But of course your explanation is that everyone except Italy is missing or hiding the vast majority of deaths nevermind the utter lack of evidence ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
fkctzz6,Let look at the direct text that the wiki text bot provided not even delving further into the article which you clearly didn take the time to look at The Schengen Area is an area comprising European states that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders The area mostly functions as single jurisdiction for international travel purposes with common visa policy Now the area mostly functions as single jurisdiction for international travel purposes You provided the numbers for two of the countries he banned You didn provide the rest because they have many more cases Now even ignoring the fact that they function as single jurisdiction for international travel purposes they have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders Now without border control how hard do you think it would be for the coronavirus to get worse in the countries that don have it too bad right now Now obviously they re enforcing the borders more now and stuff but the coronavirus can take two weeks to show it symptoms so how many people do you think have been infected and have infected many others that we don know about yet Loads So while Austria and Finland may not look like they have ton of cases let check back in two weeks And if they don have lot of known cases by then then will gladly admit that was wrong But d be willing to bet by then there will be loads more cases in both countries whereas the UK has kept to itself much more so the spread would be more contained Next time somebody link an article please at least look at the article and take seconds to think about the implications of what stated in the article Edit somebody said that Finland cases rose to yesterday from the you said There the sharp incline in talking about already appearing,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fl3iszw,LMAO damn you re full of shit Everything you listed are literally crimes of the communist party so your remark on trying to blame China as whole falls apart instantly Bats are not anywhere near common dish not at ALL As noted this virus comes from the wet market where animal to animal exposure and transfer of fluids and other excrements have happened because of lack of proper procedures Same shit happens in India That also like trying to tell China to stop eating dogs when like the previous point is very VERY small minority that occurs in very poor areas where people have to eat whatever they can just to survive and guarentee that happens just as much in India and anywhere else that ridden with poverty in the world like the slums of New York and the ghettos in London The bums gotta eat whatever they can so they do so trying to pin or blame an entirety of any country is as ignorant as me blaming all of India for the outrageous amount of internet scamming occurring everyday which yes like you mentioned is apart of gt stealing intellectual rights and spying on their privacy That you believe India isn guilty of lmao gt we still have ethics and values unlike you Yeah good ethics and values go watch all the recent vids of people exposing all of the scammers over there and you ll see the lack of ethics and values they have while robbing elderly who are ill out of their money You know what else came from bats Ebola and NIPAH which broke out in Africa and INDIA thankfully its being contained to degree but it still came from India recently and yes is deadly virus that has spread to much smaller degree So idk why you re trying to pretend as if your shit doesn stink when there certainly lot of it But you don see anyone trying to blame ALL of India for anything Why Because people are smarter than that Do think all Indians are guilty of those crimes Of course not but there are are way too many for you to try to hide and act as if they don exist ,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Carlton in Clayton They also apparently attended pre dance gathering at the house of Villa student St Louis County Executive Sam Page said Sunday that the patient family had been told on Thursday to self quarantine at their home in Ladue Page said the patient father had not followed health department instructions Page spoke at news conference Sunday evening County health officials told the man on Sunday Page said that he must remain in his home or they will issue formal quarantine that will require him and the rest of his family to stay in their home by the force of law The Villa Duchesne message advises students and parents If you attended the dance please be attentive to any symptoms you are experiencing The schools are independent Catholic schools in Frontenac Villa is an all girls school for grades seven through while Oak Hill serves coed preschoolers through sixth graders handful of seniors from John Burroughs School also may have been exposed to the virus Saturday when they gathered at the house where the pre dance event had been held earlier according to an email sent Sunday night by Andy Abbott head of John Burroughs School The family who lives at that house includes children who attend Villa and Burroughs The likelihood of any of the Burroughs students contracting the virus is extraordinarily low Abbott wrote adding that the students have been asked not to attend school until we have more information Burroughs has canceled its spring break trip to Italy Abbott said With Missouri first COVID case confirmed on Saturday health officials began the tedious work of determining with whom the woman had close contact since returning home from Italy The woman in her flew into Chicago Hare International Airport on Monday stayed with friend then took an Amtrak train home to St Louis on Wednesday according to Doug Moore spokesman for Page The woman attends an out of state school and had been studying abroad Because she was starting to feel ill the woman contacted the St Louis County Department of Public Health on Thursday Moore said She apparently stayed home and did not have contact with anyone until she was instructed on Friday to go to Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur for testing Hospital staff were notified before the woman arrived so they were able to protect themselves and isolate her from others Officials had said the woman was quarantining herself along with her parents who were not showing symptoms But on Sunday reports about the father daughter dance began circulating We are communicating with the St Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them stated Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill communications director Alice Dickherber in an email We will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment We are committed to the health and safety of our community and we will follow the guidance of public health officials as we plan for the coming days On Saturday state and county officials announced the woman test result as presumptive positive The result still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which takes few days Page said it is highly likely the CDC will confirm it Amtrak On Sunday Amtrak issued news release stating that the woman had been on Amtrak train Amtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train and as precaution we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection and are also working to do thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St Louis stations the statement read The downtown St Louis station called the Gateway Transportation Center is also hub for Greyhound Megabus and Metro St Louis The Gateway Transportation Center is following guidelines to assure the cleanliness of our facility St Louis Comptroller Darlene Green office stated in an email Investigators with the county health department spent several hours Saturday interviewing the woman to determine whether she might have had close contact with anyone else who could be at risk We go through an extensive interviewing process with the person that follows CDC protocols said Spring Schmidt acting co director of the county health department We spent several hours with her yesterday going over her movements and travel history It a difficult process that requires lot of careful interviewing and coaching and memory prompts As investigators learn more Schmidt said they are in contact with CDC officials to determine how far back they should document the woman movements who at risk of exposure and what other health agencies outside of the county may need to be involved The process of determining who needs to be notified checked for symptoms and tested is unfolding Schmidt said Those contacts may lead to more investigations as well It a cascading series of potential calls she said We won know until it starts to move forward and it continues to generate potential contact State health department director Dr Randall Williams was working Sunday alongside county health officials We are providing extra boots on the ground here There are lot of contacts that need to made Williams said We are looking at her travel schedule being on trains and planes and staying in hotels and local contacts Williams said he wanted to stress that only those in close and prolonged contact are at risk It a really important part of the message he said that when we say contact we mean to minutes within feet of the person The CDC website defines close contact as being within approximately feet of an infected person for prolonged period of time or having direct contact with an infected person secretions such as being coughed on No visitors On Sunday the Missouri Veterans Commission restricted access to its seven skilled nursing homes spread across Missouri including one in the St Louis area north of Bellefontaine Neighbors The veterans commission manages total beds The other locations include Cameron Cape Girardeau Mexico Mount Vernon St James and Warrensburg No visitors vendors nor volunteers are allowed in the facilities until further notice according to the commission website Staff is helping families communicate with each other via video chat services Starting Monday Williams said testing kits for COVID will be available commercially Physicians can order tests for their patients who they determine could be at risk he said without having to consult public health officials or meet CDC guidelines that include travel history known contact and symptoms It between the physician and the patient Williams said You can go to the doctor tomorrow and say want test and they don have to use the CDC criteria to order it Using specific throat swab doctors can send the sample to diagnostic lab for testing Williams said All positive cases must be reported to local health departments That could mean dramatic increase in the number of cases reported Williams acknowledged With million that Missouri will receive under emergency federal legislation approved last week he said public health staff will be able to adapt We are clearly prepared he said St Louis County has partly activated its emergency operations center in Ballwin bringing together public health experts paramedics police public information officers and hospital officials to provide the latest information and coordinate efforts The center has been activated during natural disasters and other threats such as the N flu outbreak in It was partly activated Friday and on Sunday was teeming with nearly people We must be prepared and educated and ready to respond at moment notice Page stated when the center was activated We have the infrastructure in place and this is an opportunity to make sure we can collaborate in real time and have the right people at the table ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

fleyc3j,It was like scene straight out of horror film That how year old Ibrahim Abu Safiya described the moment he saw someone lying on the ground near an Israeli checkpoint on the outskirts of Beit Sira village west of Ramallah We approached the man lying on the ground and he looked terribly ill Abu Safiya told Middle East Eye He had an extremely high fever He could barely move his body and he was struggling to breathe Abu Safiya said He told us that they just threw him here on the ground and left him Ibrahim Abu Safiya The man lying on the ground was Palestinian labourer who works in Israel He told Abu Safiya that he had been showing signs of the coronavirus over the past four days and was recently tested for the virus That test later came back negative But before the man allegedly resident of Nablus could receive his test results his Israeli employer reportedly called the authorities who picked him up and dropped him on the other side of the Beit Sira checkpoint which connects central Israel and the occupied West Bank He told us that they just threw him here on the ground and left him Abu Safiya recounted How could they do this to someone he asked It shouldn matter if he Palestinian Israeli or whatever He a human being Left stranded at the border When Abu Safiya and his friend came upon the man whose identity remains unknown they began filming video which has now gone viral on Palestinian social media Abu Safiya said he feared they were witnessing repeat of events from just one day before He alleges that over the weekend another Palestinian labourer who suspected he himself had contracted the virus travelled alone to the Beit Sira checkpoint in order to cross back into the West Bank When the man got there he informed locals of his condition upon which they called the Palestinian emergency services who were supposed to send an ambulance to pick him up https www middleeasteye net news occupation palestine nilin killed israel army coronavirus We lost him West Bank village in shock as Israeli army kills Palestinian Read More https www middleeasteye net news occupation palestine nilin killed israel army coronavirus Just days earlier Israel had approved the entry of thousands of Palestinian labourers into the country https www middleeasteye net news coronavirus palestine workers israel bethlehem choice livelihood isolation under the condition that they had to stay in Israel for at least month to prevent the spread of the virus in the West Bank As part of the agreement with the PA upon their return to be coordinated with Israeli authorities any workers would be immediately put into day quarantine But the fact that two workers have come or been dumped here at the nearest checkpoint with no notice and clearly no coordination is very worrying Abu Safiya said While the PA spokesman Ibrahim Melhem announced http english wafa ps page aspx id eYtSXVa aeYtSXV that the ill worker was handed to Palestinian officials at the checkpoint on Monday Abu Safiya said that was absolutely not the case Neither the man today or yesterday were dropped off by Israeli forces to Palestinian ambulance he said adding that in both cases Palestinian medics took almost three hours to arrive from Ramallah to Beit Sira The Palestinian government needs to properly coordinate with the Israeli side to prevent this from happening again he said They can just keep dropping people off here without any help The true face of the Israeli occupation Despite his shock at seeing sick man being left to die at checkpoint Abu Safiya said he wasn surprised by the incident This is the true face of the Israeli occupation he told MEE They kill us on daily basis so this isn any different for them The video filmed by Abu Safiya and his friend went viral on Palestinian social media on Monday as people expressed their outrage over the treatment of the worker Abu Safiya says the reasons it struck chord with so many people is because it is evident of the larger problem of how Israel treats Palestinian labourers and how little they value our lives he said It like we are slaves to them They use us when they need us and when they are finished they throw us away like trash Ibrahim Abu Safiya The Israeli government gave them permission to go to work knowing the risks he said And for that reason the government should also provide the workers with the proper protection Abu Safiya said he understood why so many workers chose to risk their health and safety to go work in Israel in the middle of the pandemic They had to make the impossible choice of staying healthy or letting their families starve he said So many people chose to work so they can provide for their families And we can blame them for that But Israel also wants them to work so they should take care of them If they can treat them in Israel at least don throw them to die like animals he said the frustration evident in his voice It like we are slaves to them he continued They use us when they need us and when they are finished they throw us away like trash ,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

fgg7dv9,Dr Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and run its course not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China The host Steve Bannon Trump chief campaign advisor predicted this will crush China economically and that its the end of the Xi BRI OBOR and will give US the chance to re route trade of all countries to go around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically politically etc They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies people trade businesses etc out of China This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated few days ago that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China development feets suppose it could be coincidence that China the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States according to the US itself suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly more potent than SARS which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white Caucasin population untouched at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location Wuhan being Chinese central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year it has the highest ability to spread and go super viral whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland ruining people new year quarantinee and lockdowns of cities of unprecendeted porportion causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc and doing the maximum amount of possible damaage to the Chinese economy ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points Even the SARS of had an negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as and has already turned out to be far worse and at much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths Unsuprisingly without need for single bullet fired or sanction imposed it already managed to force China to self impose the closure of its borders and cities most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself on the world stage it is another ding for China image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about whilsts at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China growing economy and hegemonic rise It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake Trade Deal and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei say something else is going on behind the scenes more than what we are being told We could have transition from Trade War to Tech War to now maybe bio war if that is the case then very likely the US already fired the first second and third shots so to speak China should at least stay vigilant and have credible deterrence contingency plan in place In the nuclear world in which China has DF the MAD doctrine is still well in place But mystery virus affords far more plausible deniability for the US Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately maybe they think better way to take China down notch or two would be the use of other means to an ends Science and technology in the world has come long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to thanksgiving them It is the human condition to be risk loss adverse nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down After all the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of rising power with declining power will inevitably lead to war and history has shown that to be indeed the case The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts with Trade War Tech and supply chain War cyberwar information and pysops war and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened Steve Bannon was hoping to break the back of the CCP by cutting off China supply chain and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change m sure both China and US have their own red lines If the US had any involvement in this new virus if China finds any credible evidence then there are number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon for example we all know the Trade War is not about trade but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS making move that would seal the US fate as the falling empire If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region so China can declare ADIZ over SCS America would be pushed back to Guam and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster Some have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill contain But believe in this case it is about maintaining plausible deniability whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future virus outbreak that dings China GDP by to in is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out of the Chinese population for example Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China central Wuhan naturally China has self interest in containment and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it Hence mission accomplished with little attribution and minimal blowback What better way to undermine China CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn for eating rats bats dogs etc this wouldn ever have befallen Perfect cover for re enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China and that of Chinese culture and Chinese ideology on the world stage All of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides Trap For various reason biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans History has shown that America is willing to wipe out entire Han civilization to maintain american hegemony and regain full spectrum dominance and supremacy ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fgj8dlu, As the Communist Party cements control more officials worry about pleasing their bosses than taking care of the people Wuhan mayor blamed higher ups senior disease control official blamed layers of bureaucracy top government expert blamed the public The people he said simply didn understand what he told them As China grapples with mysterious coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than people and sickened thousands the country billion people are asking what went wrong Senior officials are engaging in an unusually blunt display of finger pointing So many officials have denied responsibility that some online users joke that they are watching passing the buck competition It tossing the wok in Chinese The Chinese people are getting rare glimpse of how China giant opaque bureaucratic system works or rather how it fails to work Too many of its officials have become political apparatchiks fearful of making decisions that anger their superiors and too removed and haughty when dealing with the public to admit mistakes and learn from them The most important issue this outbreak exposed is the local government lack of action and fear of action said Xu Kaizhen best selling author who is famous for his novels that explore the intricate workings of China bureaucratic politics Under the high pressure environment of anti corruption campaign most people including senior government officials only care about self preservation Mr Xu said They don want to be the first to speak up They wait for their superiors to make decisions and are only accountable to their superiors instead of the people The Chinese government appears to be aware of the problem The Communist Party top leadership acknowledged in meeting on Monday that the epidemic is major test of China system and capacity for governance Growing numbers of people are questioning the government decisions as China enters period of virtual shutdown As the virus spread officials in Wuhan and around the country withheld critical information downplayed the threat and rebuked doctors who tried to raise the alarm reconstruction of the diseases spread by The New York Times showed that by not issuing earlier warnings the Chinese government potentially lost the window to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic The outbreak has undermined the myth that the Chinese political elites win assignments and promotion purely on merit China has sold this system as its own unique innovation Developing countries have sent thousands of their government officials to China to learn its model of governance political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to authoritarian rule People in China are now questioning that premise They are focusing much of their anger on Xi Jinping China top leader and the person many blame for creating culture of fear and subservience within the Chinese government Few people dare to question Mr Xi openly for fear of provoking censors or the police But after Mr Xi disappeared from public in recent days some social media users began asking euphemistically Where is that person They are also posting online and sharing pictures of former leaders at the site of past crises Critics say quietly that under Mr Xi the party began promoting loyal political cadres over technocrats the experts and skilled administrators who comprised the backbone of China bureaucracy in and when the country grew the fastest Those officials could often be corrupt but even the party fiercest critics sometimes acknowledged that they got things done Liu Zhijun the former railway minister is serving lifetime sentence for taking bribes and abusing power He also oversaw the creation of China high speed rail system which vastly improved life in the country The wok tossing in China stems in part from the tension between the technocrats who hold large number of positions with China provincial and national disease control centers and the political cadres the mayors governors and the provincial party secretaries The outbreak and lack of disclosure suggests the political cadres are winning In fact even the technocrats are becoming cadres because none of them had the courage to tell the public what they knew about the virus Chinese officials are spending as much as one third of their time on political studying sessions lot of which are about Mr Xi speeches Political loyalty weighs much more in performance evaluations than before Now the rule of thumb in Chinese officialdom seems to be demonstrating loyalty as explicitly as possible keeping everything else vague and evading responsibility at all costs when things go wrong The Chinese people may be paying the price The failures span the system Zhou Xianwang Wuhan mayor said he didn disclose the scale and danger of the epidemic earlier because he needed the authorization from higher up But he could have done something without sharing much information including telling the residents to wear masks wash hands frequently and stop big gatherings such as the potluck banquet attended by over families just few days before his city of million was locked down When information began to dribble out it was vague and misleading In series of online notices issued between Dec and Jan local officials disclosed they were treating pneumonia patients but didn say when or how many The National Health Commission the ministry with the authority to declare an epidemic emergency didn issue its own notice about the outbreak until Jan But the notice essentially kicked blame back to the local authorities The first sentence cited rule that required the commission to work with local officials on epidemic prevention top government health adviser Wang Guangfa who had reassured the public that the disease was controllable only to be sickened himself said in an interview after he recovered that he had limited information at the time He also defended his phrasing as misunderstanding by the general public saying most outbreaks of infectious diseases are controlled in the end Local officials don seem to have local people at the top of their list of priorities In an interview with state television Ma Guoqiang the Communist Party secretary of Wuhan acknowledged that Wuhan residents are little anxious and little nervous and said that he would mobilize all party cells to comfort them But the most important comfort he added came from Party Secretary Xi Jinping Mr Xu the novelist said Mr Ma remarks demonstrated how officials have more concern for pleasing their bosses than taking care of the people they allegedly serve If they can rearrange the order in their hearts Mr Xu said we ll see very different governance style As they try to contain the spread local governments are showing that they are better at looking busy than they are at finding solution Many are now finding ways to track down and even expel residents from Hubei Province to keep the coronavirus from spreading Tracking potential spreaders is sound policy but punishing or persecuting them risks driving them underground making it even harder to fight the outbreak Even outside the hardest hit areas local officials are showing they don make rules with the well being of the people in mind video that went viral across China showed couple stuck on bridge connecting Guizhou Province to the city of Chongqing The two governments had halted travel between them and the couple she from Guizhou he from Chongqing had no place to go On social media low level cadres are complaining that they are receiving so many instructions from the higher ups that they spend most of their time filling out spreadsheets instead of getting real work done In social media post headlined The Formalism Under the Mask the author wrote Most people in the system don do things to solve problems They do things to solve responsibilities After the epidemic the Chinese leadership will have to punish few officials even severely to save face and win back some credibility But for people who are suffering from the epidemic and the failure of governance the Communist Party may have hard time winning them back know before long this country will go back to being peaceful prosperous society We will hear many people screaming how proud they are of its prosperity and power Wuhan resident wrote on the social media site Weibo But after what have witnessed refuse to watch the applause and commendation ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fjgsud2,Article text gt As the leader of the World Health Organization team that visited China Dr Bruce Aylward feels he has been to the mountaintop and has seen what possible gt gt During two week visit in early February Dr Aylward saw how China rapidly suppressed the coronavirus outbreak that had engulfed Wuhan and was threatening the rest of the country gt gt New cases in China have dropped to about day from more than in early February The numbers may rise again as China economy begins to revive But for now far more new cases are appearing elsewhere in the world gt gt China counterattack can be replicated Dr Aylward said but it will require speed money imagination and political courage gt gt For countries that act quickly containment is still possible because we don have global pandemic we have outbreaks occurring globally he added gt gt Dr Aylward who has years experience in fighting polio Ebola and other global health emergencies detailed in an interview with The New York Times how he thinks the campaign against the virus should be run gt gt This conversation has been edited and condensed gt gt Do we know what this virus lethality is We hear some estimates that it close to the Spanish flu which killed percent of its victims and others that it a little worse than the seasonal flu which kills only percent How many cases are missed affects that gt gt There this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases Many people are asymptomatic when tested but develop symptoms within day or two gt gt In Guangdong they went back and retested samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening Less than percent came up positive which is about the same number as the known Covid cases in the province Covid is the medical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus gt gt There is no evidence that we re seeing only the tip of grand iceberg with nine tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus What we re seeing is pyramid most of it is aboveground gt gt Once we can test antibodies in bunch of people maybe ll be saying Guess what Those data didn tell us the story But the data we have now don support it gt gt That good if there little asymptomatic transmission But it bad in that it implies that the death rates we ve seen from percent in parts of China to percent in Wuhan are correct right gt gt ve heard it said that the mortality rate is not so bad because there are actually way more mild cases Sorry the same number of people that were dying still die The real case fatality rate is probably what it is outside Hubei Province somewhere between and percent gt What about children We know they are rarely hospitalized But do they get infected Do they infect their families gt gt We don know That Guangdong survey also turned up almost no one under Kids got flu but not this We have to do more studies to see if they get it and aren affected and if they pass it to family members But asked dozens of doctors Have you seen chain of transmission where child was the index case The answer was no gt gt Why There a theory that youngsters get the four known mild coronaviruses so often that they re protected gt gt gt That still theory couldn get enough people to agree to put it in the H report gt gt Does that imply that closing schools is pointless gt gt No That still question mark If disease is dangerous and you see clusters you have to close schools We know that causes problems because as soon as you send kids home half your work force has to stay home to take care of them But you don take chances with children gt gt Are the cases in China really going down gt gt know there suspicion but at every testing clinic we went to people would say It not like it was three weeks ago It peaked at people asking for tests day when we left it was Hospitals had empty beds gt gt didn see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued and come down faster than would have been expected Back of the envelope it hundreds of thousands of people in China that did not get Covid because of this aggressive response gt gt Is the virus infecting almost everyone as you would expect novel flu to gt gt No to percent of all clusters are in families You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or prisons but the vast majority are in families And only to percent of your close contacts develop disease So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible and find everyone you had contact with in hours before that gt gt You said different cities responded differently How gt gt It depended on whether they had zero cases sporadic ones clusters or widespread transmission gt gt First you have to make sure everyone knows the basics hand washing masks not shaking hands what the symptoms are Then to find sporadic cases they do fever checks everywhere even stopping cars on highways to check everyone gt gt As soon as you find clusters you shut schools theaters restaurants Only Wuhan and the cities near it went into total lockdown gt gt How did the Chinese reorganize their medical response gt gt First they moved percent of all medical care online so people didn come in Have you ever tried to reach your doctor on Friday night Instead you contacted one online If you needed prescriptions like insulin or heart medications they could prescribe and deliver it gt gt But if you thought you had coronavirus gt gt You would be sent to fever clinic They would take your temperature your symptoms medical history ask where you traveled your contact with anyone infected They whip you through CT scan gt gt Wait whip you through CT scan gt gt Each machine did maybe day Five minutes scan Maybe even partial scans typical hospital in the West does one or two an hour And not rays they could come up normal but CT would show the ground glass opacities they were looking for gt gt Dr Aylward was referring to lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients gt gt And then gt gt If you were still suspect case you get swabbed But lot would be told You re not Covid People would come in with colds flu runny noses That not Covid If you look at the symptoms percent have fever percent have dry coughs percent have malaise trouble breathing Runny noses were only percent gt gt The swab was for PCR test right How fast could they do that Until recently we were sending all of ours to Atlanta gt gt They got it down to four hours gt gt So people weren sent home gt gt No they had to wait You don want someone wandering around spreading virus gt gt If they were positive what happened gt gt They be isolated In Wuhan in the beginning it was days from getting sick to hospitalization They got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation That meant lot fewer infected you choke off this thing ability to find susceptibles gt gt What the difference between isolation and hospitalization gt gt With mild symptoms you go to an isolation center They were set up in gymnasiums stadiums up to beds But if you were severe or critical you go straight to hospitals Anyone with other illnesses or over age would also go straight to hospitals gt gt What were mild severe and critical We think of mild as like minor cold gt gt No Mild was positive test fever cough maybe even pneumonia but not needing oxygen Severe was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down so needing oxygen or ventilator Critical was respiratory failure or multi organ failure gt gt So saying percent of all cases are mild doesn mean what we thought gt gt m Canadian This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses people didn think it was big enough or fast enough to have the impact it does gt gt Hospitals were also separated gt gt Yes The best hospitals were designated just for Covid severe and critical All elective surgeries were postponed Patients were moved Other hospitals were designated just for routine care women still have to give birth people still suffer trauma and heart attacks gt gt They built two new hospitals and they rebuilt hospitals If you had long ward they build wall at the end with window so it was an isolation ward with dirty and clean zones You go in gown up treat patients and then go out the other way and de gown It was like an Ebola treatment unit but without as much disinfection because it not body fluids gt gt How good were the severe and critical care gt gt China is really good at keeping people alive Its hospitals looked better than some see here in Switzerland We ask How many ventilators do you have They say Wow We say How many ECMOs They say five The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said Five In Germany you get three maybe And just in Berlin gt gt ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines which oxygenate the blood when the lungs fail gt gt Who paid for all of this gt gt The government made it clear testing is free And if it was Covid when your insurance ended the state picked up everything gt gt In the S that a barrier to speed People think If see my doctor it going to cost me If end up in the C what it going to cost me That ll kill you That what could wreak havoc This is where universal health care coverage and security intersect The S has to think this through ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

fkkkf5b,For years the housekeepers have met every morning at Westwood cafe for coffee and conversation before starting their workday They talk about their children and grandchildren family back in Central America and problems with husbands or work The chats have served as kind of therapy But in the past month their numbers at the cafe have begun to dwindle courtesy of an unwanted visitor fear over the coronavirus As the pandemic continues to spread with growing numbers in the S more and more employers are telling their domestic workers to stay home On Friday President Trump declared national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak Many of those fortunate to be able to keep making their living were nevertheless dealt blow on Friday as the Los Angeles Unified district closed all its schools complicating their ability to make sure their children were looked after while they work On recent weekday morning Doralicia Bermudez sat with handful of women topping yuca with curtido that someone brought in for breakfast family she works for canceled on her over fear of coronavirus They don pay she said And the bills keep coming Companies across the S have been urging employees to work from home in response to the growing viral outbreak in the country But for many caregivers and domestic workers that not an option Housekeepers Dora Mayen and Marta Espinoza right who work as housekeepers meet for morning coffee together at cafe near UCLA Patrick Fallon For The Times Staying home is luxury said year old Sonia Rodriguez who works six days week cleaning houses and serving as caregiver for senior with Alzheimer disease Rodriguez who recently lost her husband lives in San Fernando with her four children Many of the housekeepers take buses to get to work They worry this leaves them exposed to the virus which thrives on close contact Experts have suggested that people practice social distancing to stay safe But like staying home this too feels like luxury they can afford If they quarantine us Rodriguez said where are we going to get money There are an estimated million domestic workers across the country Most don have access to healthcare and do not get paid sick days according to Ai jen Poo founder and director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance On call with domestic workers last week Poo heard from workers worried about losing jobs and not being able to put food on the table nanny for example said she was fired by employers who said they were doing social distancing and didn want anyone coming into their house Housekeepers Housekeeper Dora Mayen boards bus after meeting for morning coffee with other housekeepers at cafe near UCLA before heading out to work in homes in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles Patrick Fallon For The Times From wages and income perspective most domestic workers can afford to take single day off Poo said When you look at the world through the eyes of domestic workers you start to see the ways in which the crisis is compounded for low wage workers The National Domestic Workers Alliance has focused on passing bills of rights for domestic workers and created benefits platform that allows employers to contribute to an account that would help workers to get paid time off and insurance This is such precarious workforce Poo said ve often described the domestic work industry as the Wild West because there such long history of exclusion from basic rights and protections As the coronavirus continues to spread with more than cases in the S as of Saturday afternoon some organizations are offering advice on how to support caregivers and domestic workers Hand in Hand national network of employers of nannies house cleaners and home attendants has released guide on How to be fair employer during

care for themselves or family members who might be sick For Carmen Solano Brentwood housekeeper the subject of coronavirus hasn come up with her employers In the fall Solano was one of number of housekeepers who showed up to work in neighborhood that was under mandatory evacuation because of the Getty fire Solano has diabetes and worries about the coronavirus which is especially dangerous not only to older people but those who have underlying health issues Some counties have warned the elderly and people with asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes chronic liver disease blood disorders and other conditions to remain at home as much as possible But Solano needs the money to pay her rent already make so little for rent she said don want to end up on the street At the Westwood cafe hand sanitizer was fixture in workers bags tucked beside extra pairs of shoes and lunches The women slid into booths next to one another or crowded around tables stashing rain jackets in their bags Ahora las voy saludar asi joked Rodriguez holding hand close to her mouth and blowing air kisses at the four women seated at corner table Now will greet you like this Each time the door opened the women turned prepared to greet another friend They ve known each other for years Some met as they shared bus to work on the Westside others in this cafe near UCLA Many of them fled El Salvador decades ago trying to escape civil war that tore the country apart We re here for each other in the good times and the bad said year old Sonia Esperanza Valencia who has worked as housekeeper in Westwood home for over years She watched her employers daughters grow up One of the girls told her that when she got married she wanted Valencia there Valencia phone is filled with pictures of the

after one family let her go over cough If Rodriguez has to stay home either because she or her employers become ill two of the five families she works for said they will keep paying her for about

fkctjfr,Sure gt Read President Trump Speech on Coronavirus Pandemic Full Transcript gt Speaking from the Oval Office Mr Trump announced suspension of travel from Europe for days starting on Friday gt My fellow Americans tonight want to speak with you about our nation unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world gt Today the World Health Organization officially announced that this is global pandemic gt We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people gt This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront foreign virus in modern history am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus gt From the beginning of time nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges including large scale and very dangerous health threats This is the way it always was and always will be It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism gt Our team is the best anywhere in the world At the very start of the outbreak we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over years We declared public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection gt And taking early intense action we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe gt The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots As result large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe gt After consulting with our top government health professionals have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans gt To keep new cases from entering our shores we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next days The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground gt There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom gt At the same time we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea And as their situation improves we will re evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for possible early opening gt Earlier this week met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co payments for coronavirus treatments extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing gt We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus gt Additionally last week signed into law an billion funding bill to help D and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines treatments and distribution of medical supplies Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly day by day We are moving very quickly gt The vast majority of Americans The risk is very very low Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions The elderly population must be very very careful gt In particular we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits In general older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas gt My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks and we have issued guidance on school closures social distancing and reducing large gatherings gt Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow gt Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts and they are the best gt For all Americans it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene Each of us has role to play in defeating this virus Wash your hands clean often used surfaces cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough and most of all if you are sick or not feeling well stay home gt To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship will soon be taking emergency action which is unprecedented to provide financial relief This will be targeted for workers who are ill quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus gt will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief gt Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far gt Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong Our unemployment is at historic low This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility reserves and resources to handle any threat that comes our way gt This is not financial crisis this is just temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as nation and as world gt However to provide extra support for American workers families and businesses tonight am announcing the following additional actions am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus gt Effective immediately the B will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories These low interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus To this end am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional billion gt Using emergency authority will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted This action will provide more than billion of additional liquidity to the economy gt Finally am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief Hopefully they will consider this very strongly gt We are at critical time in the fight against the virus We made lifesaving move with early action on China Now we must take the same action with Europe We will not delay will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives health and safety of the American people will always put the well being of America first gt If we are vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection which we will we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus The virus will not have chance against us gt No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States We have the best economy the most advanced health care and the most talented doctors scientists and researchers anywhere in the world gt We are all in this together We must put politics aside stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family gt As history has proven time and time again Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity gt Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine Acting with compassion and love we will heal the sick care for those in need help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before gt God bless you and God bless America Thank you There

fkulj5d,for people who are not interested in reading this article which is the original report Honestly wasn sure how to begin this story or how to fit all the insanity into the title It a story involving patents patent trolling Covid Theranos and even the company that brought us all WeWork SoftBank Oh and also Irell amp Manella the same law firm that once claimed it could represent monkey in copyright infringement dispute You see Irell amp Manella has now filed one of the most utterly bullshit patent infringement lawsuits you ll ever see They are representing Labrador Diagnostics LLC patent troll which does not seem to exist other than to file this lawsuit and which claims to hold the rights to two patents US Patents and which you ll note were originally granted to Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos the firm that shut down in scandal over medical testing equipment that appears to have been oversold and never actually worked Holmes is still facing federal charges of wire fraud over the whole Theranos debacle However back in the remains of Theranos sold its patents to Fortress Investment Group Fortress Investment Group is SoftBank funded massive patent troll You may remember the name from the time last fall when Apple and Intel sued the firm laying out how Fortress is sort of uber patent troll gathering up bunch of patents and then shaking down basically everyone Lovely right So this SoftBank owned patent troll Fortress bought up Theranos patents and then set up this shell company Labrador Diagnostics which decided that right in the midst of the Covid pandemic it was going to sue one of the companies making Covid tests saying that its test violates those Theranos patents and literally demanding that the court bar the firm from making those Covid tests bit more background here the company they re suing BioFire recently launched three Covid tests built off of the company FilmArray technology And that what Labrador read SoftBank is now suing over gt From the lawsuit The Accused Products embody at least claim of the Patent literally or under the doctrine of equivalents as set forth below The further descriptions below which are based on publicly available information are preliminary examples and are non limiting On information and belief the FilmArray FilmArray EZ and FilmArray Torch devices operate together with the FilmArray pouches and software similarly as pertinent to the non limiting examples set forth below On information and belief the FilmArray EZ operates in substantially the same manner as the FilmArray and as such is not separately addressed below For the purposes of infringement Plaintiff Labrador non limiting examples relating to the FilmArray are equally applicable to the FilmArray EZ albeit with use of at least the RP EZ Panel designed for use with the FilmArray EZ See BioFire Diagnostics Website https www biofiredx com products the filmarraypanels filmarray respiratory panel ez So let summarize The firm that basically created the mess that is WeWork by dumping billions of dollars into the company also owns patent troll that bought up the patents from the sham medical testing firm Theranos and is now using those patents to sue one of the few diagnostics companies that is actually making Covid test in the middle of pandemic And demanding the use of those tests be blocked That Defendants be enjoined from infringing the Asserted Patents or if their infringement is not enjoined that Defendants be ordered to pay ongoing royalties to Labrador for any post judgment infringement of the Asserted Patents Honestly m used to all sorts of awfulness but this one piles awfulness upon awfulness and takes it to level of pure evil The lawyers filing this lawsuit on behalf of Labrador should remember what they ve done filing bullshit patent trolling lawsuit on behalf of shell company for notorious giant patent troll using patents from sham company and using them to try to block the use of Covid diagnostic tests in the middle of pandemic wonder how they sleep at night For the record there are two law firms behind this filing Irell amp Manella is the big one and they list out different lawyers on this complaint Morgan Chu Alan Heinrich Keith Orso Adina Stohl Dennis Courtney Brian Weissenberg and Chaplin Carmichael Their local firm is Farnan LLP and the lawyers there are Brian and Michael Farnan Morgan Chu is the big shot at Irell and runs its litigation group He should take on much of the responsibility for this awful awful lawsuit Farnan LLP was formed by former federal district court judge Joseph Farnan and ll just note that out of its attorneys including the two on this case have the same last name understand the need for zealous representation of client in court but this seems even more despicable than your every day patent trolling and people should associate these lawyers names with the truly despicable behavior on display here Similarly it should be reminder of why its good thing that the Supreme Court decided decade and half ago that injunctions are often inappropriate in patent cases know that there an effort underway to have Congress change the law to overrule the Supreme Court decision on that point but imagine how that would play out in this scenario in which necessary diagnostic testing might get blocked due to some patent troll with deep pockets

fj4agpq,Can take moment to speak for the most vulnerable group that will be hardest affected and least recognized if when the coronavirus hits honestly believe mortality rates could be as high as for this population yet doubt it will make headlines am nurse working for human services organization in community setting in the US work with Individuals with Severe Intellectual and Developmental disabilities Despite the severity and nature of many of their disabilities they are very much like you and These are real people with feelings fears life goals hopes and dreams that reside within many community settings in America My employer operates several day programs and quite few group homes medical and non medical that these individual reside in have been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about their lives needs and medical fragility in comprehensive way in my role as the agency healthcare supervisor As helpless as have felt at times this week hope that speaking about their plight will at the very least help to spread awareness and hopefully some voluntary support within your own communities if the need arises honestly never thought that in the course of my career there would come time where would be terrified for the health and welfare of so many people that have come to truly love and care for The following reasons are why think so many could potentially perish The department of developmental services has thus far failed to issue any guidance and for many smaller agencies like the one am employed by am their highest level of medical expertise in potentially deadly crisis only have bachelors of science in nursing This entire week have had to run so many nightmare scenarios in my mind in an effort to create contingency plans that am mentally and emotionally exhausted What if our staff become too ill to care for our patients and are unable to provide care that is literally necessary to sustain life How many could die What is the mitigation What if they get any of these individuals sick How quickly would it spread With no current reliable rapid test how can and my nursing staff quickly identify and isolate When most are so vulnerable to viral illness that many currently have flu like symptoms with several having progressed to pneumonia did the best could with the resources and knowledge available to me to help my agency prepare But clinically my own assessment is that at best it will buy us some time but realistically won be enough to be truly effective in the long run There are no government contingency plans to assist our facilities with emergency supplies of medical protective equipment or staffing if need becomes critical suspect they have the capabilities to do so as DDS also runs its own facilities and group homes in many states on large scale But for this vulnerable population severely underfunded non profit agencies have thus far been left to figure out their own contingency and mitigation plans On the most basic level most of my patients have little to no concept of proper hygiene Many have poor hygiene and hygiene practices for various reasons ranging from water aversion tactile issues diffuclties with recall all the way to caregiver inability difficulty in providing necessary care So this effective prevention tool will be ineffective can respond in more detail about the non medical components if anyone is interested In terms of the medical piece this is an extremely fragile group of people many have complicated co morbidities such as compromised immune systems respiratory systems cardiac systems and on and on Most of my patients have disabilities that are profound and require lot of medical and direct supportive care Some are vent dependent some with traches many require careful respiratory management The regular flu strains kill disproportionate amount in this community every year cannot even begin to imagine how many of my own could die due to the direct and indirect results of this virus The worst part is how completely and utterly hopeless this situation is starting to seem due to the complete mismanagement and lack of leadership in our current administration ,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

fjg9wtk,Corinna doesn ask me for anything and have to ask times day no explicitly offer if can bring something He does not want to be burden to me In Persian the concept of taarof is an exaggerated ceremonial insincerity for reasons of politeness One own will is denied in order to convey feeling of recognition of the other person It can happen that in Tehran one has to hold out the money to the taxi driver times until he does not refuse it anymore Sometime read that this behavior is still handed down from the time of the nomadic culture cook Skrei with mashed potatoes and frozen spinach When give him the food he tells me through his mouth guard that he saw snow for the first time two days ago joke Maybe it ll be your last He not laughing feel like shit Sunday March st The result of the roommate of the Corona OG has arrived Corona Lite is negative We are thrilled The hope that also Corinna has negative test is rising He hopes that this will shorten his quarantine period and that he will be able to take part in the exams he has been preparing for so long We are waiting with tension for the result The doctors take good care of us and contact us several times by phone think to myself that this must be incredibly stressful and time consuming to contact all Ronnys at risk of infection individually offer my mail address No this is not allowed for DSGVO reasons Here the system in Germany is about years behind Mail is standard since why can everybody get PGP Public Key and receive signed encrypted mails How many working hours or rather time to recover could be made possible for the visibly overworked doctors by this Even an end to end encrypted communication via signal or telegram would be conceivable But before something like this happens in Germany we all pay in Bitcoin Monday March have dry cough try to go out on the balcony to get some fresh air regularly but the radiators keep the ambient air consistently equivalent in temperature and humidity to Phoenix Arizona in August After the public order office announced twice day to make sure Corinna doesn escape today is the first time you come You say that you will now only come once day Apart from the fact that the Public Order Office has never been there twice day before this is of course Big Brain Move to tell people that you have been there once today and won come again If someone wanted to leave his quarantine now he would now have clearly defined time window But cannot blame the staff d rather forgive parking tickets in the pedestrian zone than bring my family viruses for dinner at the hourly rate The medical staff are provided with Tyvek suits and masks The people from the public order office are indistinguishable from the traffic wardens Corinna is still asymptomatic There is still no result Tuesday March The results are in Corinna has always been model pupil and has also passed this test Positive for SARS CoV am strengthened in my decision that it was wise not to follow the public order office and instead stay in the flat share and not to go to my relatives am now also being called Although am self employed am getting promotion From to Everythings coming up Milhouse is contact person with an increased risk of infection ll be verbally committed to legally binding quarantine Until when When was the last time you had contact with Corinna He in the next room When was the last time you had contact with him without mask Thursday To determine my quarantine period we do not take the fact that we still live in the same apartment as before but we assume the optimized case that our spatial separation and the meticulous disinfection of the shared sanitary facilities worked The fact that could have been infected only today when handed over the rice pudding is neglected here The beginning of my quarantine was Thursday In the morning team of doctors will come by and take smear test on me If the test is negative will be allowed to leave the quarantine on March The doctors will roll up and change their clothes in the stairwell Face mask hair protection glasses disposable gowns They come in and interrogate me in the kitchen about my contacts since February th m not supposed to contact anyone yet am not forbidden to do so but am advised not to cause unnecessary mass panic That understandable To this day even my parents don know what happening to me lied to my mother about drowning in work and not being able to come home for while Corinna on the other hand now has to name all his contacts and they are called by the health department The doctors insist that do the smear test in my room and walk over my carpet with their usual shoes There seem to be no more overshoes My temperature is measured with laser thermometer on my forehead All Gucci My result should come tomorrow The doctors are trying to organize an isolated hospital bed for Corinna so that don have to share the apartment with person who tested positive The doctors are trying really hard and are polite but you can tell that you don have the right answers and you have been thrown into the deep end with Corona Yesterday you were general practitioner in town with souls today you are at the spearhead of global epidemic The Robert Koch Institute provides all information but especially about the course of the disease there are still many unanswered questions wish we had health minister without chancellor aspirations wish we didn have this clown in the White House wish hadn seen the film Contagion Meanwhile our case is in the newspapers Acquaintances and friends send me the articles and memes without suspecting my direct connection The press reports about our concrete case with astonishing accuracy recognize myself and my roommate by the job title Only my age is wrong My birthday is tomorrow So far the conclusion is that the public health department and the public order officials in the city are doing their best But in my boundless pessimism believe that things will get worse before they get better We can only hope that most of the infected people do not have any chronic pre existing conditions and that the virus only leads to small flu like infection There is hope that there will be vaccine available soon to protect the elderly population before the virus has spread too far in our society But every cloud also has silver lining Maybe in months the pension question

fjax6k9,North Korea Launches Unidentified Projectiles South Korea Says The firing of the projectiles could be the country first missile tests since Nov and comes amid political shake up as the North responds to the coronavirus threat photo released on Friday by the North Korean state media showed the country leader Kim Jong un monitoring military drill photo released on Friday by the North Korean state media showed the country leader Kim Jong un monitoring military drill Credit Korean Central News Agency via Reuters Choe Sang Hun By Choe Sang Hun Published March Updated March m ET SEOUL South Korea North Korea launched two short range projectiles off its east coast on Monday in the country first weapons test in three months returning to its provocative behavior year after Kim Jong un failed summit meeting with President Trump The projectiles were launched near Wonsan port town east of Pyongyang the North Korean capital South Korean military officials said They flew miles before landing in the waters between North Korea and Japan the officials said adding that they were analyzing data to determine the type of projectiles used in the launch South Korean officials said the launch on Monday appeared to be part of military drill North Korea began on Friday This kind of act by North Korea does not help efforts to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula the South Korean military said in statement We once again urge the North to immediately stop it In its previous weapons test on Nov North Korea launched two rockets from its east coast firings that were overseen by Mr Kim the country leader South Korea later said the two short range projectiles were fired from what North Korea called super large multiple rocket launcher new weapon the North had developed to target South Korean and United States military bases farther from North Korea border with the South But North Korea had been refraining from any weapons tests since Mr Kim told meeting at the end of December that he had all but abandoned hopes for diplomacy with Washington and ordered his country to brace for prolonged standoff with the United States and endure sanctions In that meeting Mr Kim also said his country no longer felt bound by its self imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long range ballistic missiles and that the world would witness new strategic weapon in the near future Mr Kim has also been keeping himself largely from public view as he locked his country down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus outbreak from neighboring China On Friday he appeared to resume his public activities inspecting joint strike drill of units of the North Korean People Army according to the state run media The military drill coincided with the anniversary of Mr Kim summit last year with President Trump in Hanoi Vietnam The summit collapsed over differences over how fast North Korea would roll back its nuclear weapons program and when Washington should ease sanctions The Monday launch came three days after Mr Kim fired one of his closest aides for corruption during meeting of the Political Bureau of his Workers Party The meeting focused on enforcing top class anti epidemic measures to contain the viral epidemic spreading rapidly across the world although the North itself has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus During the meeting Mr Kim excoriated abuse of power practices of privileges indulgence in bureaucracy corruption and irregularities among senior officials of the party Central Committee and at the party cadre training center Then the rubber stamp Political Bureau dismissed Ri Man gon and Pak Thae dok from the posts of vice chairmen of the Central Committee it said Mr Ri was one of the most prominent North Korean officials to fall out of Mr Kim favor in recent years As vice chairman of the Central Committee Mr Ri has helped Mr Kim in monitoring the loyalty of the party elites and helping Mr Kim decide whom to promote or demote Mr Ri has also led the party powerful Department of Organization and Guidance which does the same work The North latest launch the first in three months came at time when South Korea was grappling with an explosive outbreak of the coronavirus with more than cases the largest number outside China North Korea first weapons test this year came days after the United States and South Korea postponed their joint annual military drills originally scheduled for this month because of the coronavirus outbreak North Korea appears intent on raising the stakes before South Korea April elections and before the Super Tuesday primaries of the S presidential campaign said Leif Eric Easley professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul North Korea is making clear with these missile tests it will continue to improve military capabilities and make outsized demands despite the political and public health preoccupations of Beijing Seoul and Washington South Korea holds its parliamentary

fkvm8sj, TL DR Cuts to payroll taxes would jeopardize social security reserves already threatened with future depletion and would not at all benefit those most affected economically by the public health crisis e the estimated percent of the workforce that could lose their jobs Trump Payroll Tax Cut Would Dwarf the Bank Bailout President Trump is pushing nearly trillion fiscal stimulus that some economists say would not be well targeted to offset damage from the coronavirus By Jim Tankersley March WASHINGTON Almost overnight President Trump has gone from insisting the economy would not need fiscal help to weather the coronavirus to proposing stimulus plan that would cost more than the Wall Street bank bailout or the stimulus bill aimed at digging the United States out of deep recession The centerpiece of Mr Trump stimulus proposal which remains work in progress is temporary tax cut that by itself would add nearly trillion to the national debt suspension of all Social Security payroll taxes through the end of the year Some economists have cheered the idea as the right move at fraught moment when workers are quarantined schools are closing and large gatherings are being canceled But others including those who have called for aggressive congressional action say the plan would be an inefficient way of stoking consumer demand at time of supply shortages and growing number of quarantines Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have given the proposal cool reception Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee told reporters on Wednesday that he did not see need for immediate action on payroll tax cut Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland the second ranking Democrat in the House said Wednesday that the proposal was nonstarter Mr Trump and his top advisers have pitched the cut as much needed lift for consumers and businesses at time when the spreading virus is beginning to chill economic activity The payroll tax holiday is probably the most important powerful piece of this Larry Kudlow the director of the National Economic Council told reporters on Tuesday Under Mr Trump plan as described by Peter Navarro one of his economic advisers the government would through the end of the year stop collecting the percent Social Security tax currently taken out of workers paychecks and the percent tax taken for Medicare It would also suspend equally large taxes paid on behalf of workers by their employers Self employed workers would be relieved of the entire percent tax they currently pay For workers earnings that are no longer subject to the payroll tax would now be subject to federal income taxes Because lower paid workers have lower marginal income tax rates they would see slightly larger percentage increase in their pay than workers with higher salaries Some extremely high paid workers would not see an increase at all because payroll taxes are capped by income and some workers are close to or have already reached that limit This means they are not set to have any Social Security taxes taken out for the rest of the year As general rule the largest percentage income gains would go to households earning up to year according to calculations by the Tax Foundation nonprofit in Washington The largest gains in dollar figures would go to households earning more than year according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington How much individual workers would save depends partly on their employers If an employer half of payroll taxes was lifted they would need to decide whether to pass those savings directly to workers in the form of higher pay Some economists see both sides of that equation as beneficial at time of slowing economic activity The full payroll tax suspension would not only increase workers take home pay but would ease cash flow constraints for employers who are likely to face rough patch in the incoming months said Karl Smith the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation which traditionally supports cutting taxes to spur economic growth Mr Smith said he supported the Trump proposal though the Tax Foundation had not taken an official position The payroll tax would be great Mr Trump said on Wednesday Dems are not in favor of it m trying to figure out why Democrats are opposed for several reasons Many economists including liberals and conservatives who have called for stimulus measures say there are much more effective ways to stoke demand and support growth during viral outbreak They note that cutting payroll taxes only helps Americans who are still working and not those who are furloughed by quarantines or laid off amid floundering sales The benefits would arrive gradually across paychecks instead of in one stimulative burst payroll tax cut like the president wants wouldn help the elderly non employed who are at the most risk from the virus Michael Strain an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute wrote Wednesday on Twitter It would provide larger benefit to the well off And it isn targeted on those who need it Claudia Sahm an economist at the liberal Washington Center for Equitable Growth said Thursday that lawmakers could still ward off recession with stimulus but payroll tax won do it She and Mr Strain both favor giving cash assistance to Americans Cutting payroll taxes will be too slow and its effects too small Ms Sahm said So small most won even notice it Those who don have or will lose their jobs won get it at all The political calculations around payroll tax cuts are fraught The tax feeds the Social Security Trust Fund while administration officials said they would most likely divert other money to avoid robbing the fund cutting payroll taxes would further balloon the rising budget deficit The Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimates that suspending the tax through December would reduce federal revenues by billion the Tax Foundation said it could top billion The initial price tag for the Wall Street bailout was billion though less than billion was actually spent and taxpayers ultimately recouped most of the funds President Barack Obama stimulus package cost about billion over the course of several years The full cost of Mr Trump proposals including assistance to affected industries like tourism and sick pay for quarantined workers is likely to be tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars larger than the payroll tax cut alone If enacted such package would most likely push the federal budget deficit to over trillion for the year Data released Thursday by the Treasury Department show the deficit which has grown significantly in recent years in part because of Mr Trump tax cuts is on pace to reach nearly trillion for the fiscal year The record in nominal dollars for an annual deficit in the United States is trillion during the depths of the financial crisis

fj6mf9p,I a fan of the English language being used properly Literally there are lots of things that aren better than praying for the coronavirus to go away Have you seen the Princess Bride get the point there nothing wrong with praying but that can be all or even the first thing that you do get it but if you re going to go around as an atheist pointing out how others are wrong in their beliefs or actions you need to be sure that you are at least mildly correct in that pointing out Otherwise you look like hypocrite and moron neither of which is good for your argument And that not even pointing out that since nobody can prove the existence or non existence of any god for all any of us know praying is the best first thing to do m not saying it is m saying nobody really knows So unless praying the virus away was the only thing they did and it could be don follow the news pointing out that they did pray is self serving for the atheist because the argument then exists only as weapon to attack believers Better think to say praying is fine but just in case it useless we could be doing lot of other things to help But saying that literally anything is better than praying is technically incorrect grammatically wonky and really through the incorrect use of the language which m assuming you natively speak just makes you look like an asshole And believe it or not when one is in the business of arguing as is the case between atheists and believers one should try one very best not to look like an asshole That all m saying ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

publication Hello all am one of the archivists at Library and Archives Canada LAC that works on philately stamps and postal history and Canadian art We write blog posts about our acquisitions and so for some distraction from the current COVID situation you can read about the history of our almost flag from Donald Nelson Baird and the Parliamentary Flag Design Committee By James Bone Archivist Background of the flag design competition From the time of Confederation through to the debates of the quest to give visual identification to the Canadian nation through an official flag was an elusive one While at various times the Union flag of the United Kingdom and the Canadian Red Ensign stood in unofficially for Canada attempts to create our own flag never bore fruit Prime Minister Mackenzie King made an attempt between and through the Second World War there were periods of renewed interest that would invariably fizzle due to partisan differences in Parliament At the end of the War King again sought solution to the problem and in November his government struck joint House of Commons and Senate committee that was to consider and report upon suitable and distinct flag for Canada To achieve this task the committee announced its intention to accept design submissions from the public Submissions received To say that the committee was inundated with potential designs would be an understatement By the time of the submission deadline the official count was and many more would arrive after the deadline Records of the committee which include sampling of copies of correspondence thanking people for their submissions reveal that among those to submit design proposals were people such as the artist David Milne and Dominion Archivist Gustave Lanct along with children veterans and Canadians of all sorts To facilitate discussion voting and elimination of designs the committee created process to count and classify the elements found in each submission Prominent elements were maple leaves beavers the Union Jack and the Fleur de Lys During its mandate the committee also received and kept correspondence from the public with letters ranging from those supportive of the process to find suitable national flag to reflect the identity of the country to those who felt any new flag would dishonour the memory of the recent war dead Likewise some correspondents made it known that the inclusion of any element of French identity would be unacceptable while others pushed for flag that reflected both the British and the French heritages of Canada although few offered the idea to include Indigenous elements or to avoid privileging European elements altogether Donald Nelson Baird and his submission One of the submissions received by the committee arrived by way of Dorothy Baird of Truro Nova Scotia on behalf of her younger brother Donald Nelson Baird Originally from Glace Bay Nova Scotia Donald had suffered the effects of polio as child and had only limited use of his arms hands and legs Despite this hardship he learned to draw and paint with watercolours and would soon find himself at the centre of national debate on the future of the Canadian flag https imgur com trB d jpg https imgur com trB d jpg Image of Donald Nelson Baird Abbass Studio Limited copyright expired Library and Archives Canada Mikan no The design created by Baird was not overly complex as described in the minutes of the committee minutes it was simply Canadian Red Ensign with maple leaf in autumn golden colour replacing the Coat of Arms on the fly The design was small watercolour painting on paper and like all submissions received an identifying number from the committee https imgur com dkZGX jpg https imgur com dkZGX jpg Donald Nelson Baird flag design watercolour on paper copyright assigned to Library and Archives Canada Library and Archives Canada Mikan no reproduction no The design had appeal to many members of the committee which had indeed received several similar designs However given its prominent use of the Union Jack red field and lack of French symbol this appeal was obviously not unanimous Later the lack of French symbol and the inability of the committee to reach unanimous decision would be sufficient cause for King to dismiss the design as suitable flag for Canada While the eventual final design changed slightly from Baird submission as discussed below was officially the product and creation of the committee itself correspondence from W Gladstone Member of Parliament on the committee reveals that as Baird design most suited the mood of most of the committee for publicity purposes Baird would be designated the winner of the competition should his design prevail https imgur com LVsRQaV jpg https

fl09sz6,China has to be held accountable for hiding this COVID cases and yes China would have saved many lives if they combat this virus with transparency Don forget China went through SARS outbreak just like Taiwan did and look at what they have learned from SARS Nothing Not sure if you can recall what China told WHO the world and their own residents The timeline of China response to this coronavirus is as follow Jan China arrested Dr Lee Wengling accusing him of spreading the rumour that there is none identified SARS like virus happening in Wuhan China state and propaganda machined denied that there was any health issue and punished doctors who tried to warn their loved ones Obviously this health crisis already started rolling in December Taiwan sent the expert to investigate in Wuhan in December after trying many times to coordinate with the Chinese government for this field visit Of course China did not show the Taiwanese experts the field where it needed to be investigated warning was given to WHO by the Taiwanese CDC but of course the advice was not delivered to the WHO members And then back in January China couldn hide this novel coronavirus has been spreading in China so they finally told WHO that yes there is such virus but nothing serious The Chinese government told WHO that this virus does not spread to humans nothing to worry about the risk is low Again Taiwanese experts did not believe that and started setting up the national health commend center in TW After that the Chinese government told WHO that this virus human transmission is very minimal nothing to worried about as the risk is low Following that it started human transmission China epidemiologist told WHO that this virus can be prevented and contained nothing to worry about and the risk is low This epidemiologist was tested positive and confirmed infected few days after he made this announcement Then the most interesting data showed that this Novel Coronavirus only appear within Wuhan but nowhere else in China While the first case in the US was founded on Jan th in Washington Obviously the Chinese government either did not test the residents outside Wuhan or it hid the number However China indicated that they have been transparent and WHO was their speaker for that During this time some BBC interviewed some Chinese in Wuhan and other cities in China asking how they are dealing with the virus every single person said they trust their Chinese Communist Party None of them were wearing masks They also mocked the world overreacting on this virus Keep in mind the outbreak already started during the time they were interviewed Then Chairman Xi finally came out that it is not allowed to hide the epidemic condition they need to be transparent The day after Xi announcement confirmed cases started to appear in the entire country The day after the data started to show cases outside of Wuhan the outbreak hit the entire country Not long after the nationwide outbreak China government locked down Wuhan City Chinese people only started to wear masks The government announced that Wuhan will be locked down Chinese living in Wuhan used the few hours before locked down initiation and escaped to the rest of the world and brought this virus everywhere Note that there are million Chinese living in Italy this is why Italy becomes the epicentre in Europe If you recall what Dr Tredos from WHO has been doing since last December he had only been praising China and took no action to spread the truth to the WHO members which are every nation on earth except Taiwan Taiwan also had sources that China already started bulk buying masks in the world back in December When the virus outbreak in China Chinese around the world started bulk buying the masks in every country lot of them were panic but lot of them were making money by selling the masks at really high price Italy and many other nations also donated lot of their masks to China heard Italy donated most of their national reserve If WHO had been honest or responsible for telling the truth Italy would not have to buy back those masks they donate to China at high price Americans have not lived in time of pandemic apocalypse in the past years nor the US allies in Europe The social issues that the US is facing are different than Asian countries but am pretty sure the severeness of the global pandemic is caused by China remember seeing the CNN reporting that China refused to export the medical supplies and masks made by the US company to the US This is concept of occupying properties that do not belong to and they had no problem doing that Back in January and early February the Chinese foreign ministry speaker even criticized that the US has not helped China fighting this outbreak The fact that the US had to give loads of masks and other medical supplies to China in exchange to pick up Americans stocked in Wuhan few days ago the Chinese foreign ministry speaker also publicly accusing that the American soldiers brought the virus to China The China regime has been plotting misinformation backing this theory in many countries There has been no apology from China for causing this global health crisis yet they already started to rewrite history This regime has never been honest on the first day founded in history Taiwanese know it well and people in Taiwan had paid big price to know it well The Chinese government was not fighting battle with the virus they never were Nothing is more important than holding political power in the world by stigmatizing other nations

fgwqi3d,Here is his statement in full We have faced the new coronavirus nCoV situation for about two weeks now The Ministerial Task Force advised by DPM Heng Swee Keat has been leading the Government response to this outbreak They have been dealing with new developments every day and holding regular press briefings to keep Singaporeans informed every step of the way Today want to speak to you directly to explain where we are and what may lie ahead We went through Sars years ago so we are much better prepared to deal with nCoV this time Practically we have stockpiled adequate supplies of masks and Personal Protective Equipment PPE We have expanded and upgraded our medical facilities including the new National Centre for Infectious Diseases NCID We have more advanced research capabilities to study the virus We have more well trained doctors and nurses to deal with this situation We are psychologically better prepared too Singaporeans know what to expect and how to react Most importantly having overcome Sars once we know that we can pull through this too The new coronavirus is similar to Sars but with two important differences First the new virus is more infectious than Sars Therefore it is harder to stop it from spreading Second the new virus is much less dangerous than Sars About per cent of those who caught Sars died With the new virus outside of Hubei province the mortality rate is so far only per cent In comparison seasonal influenza has death rate of per cent So in terms of mortality the new virus is much closer to influenza than Sars But the situation is still evolving Every day brings new developments and we have to respond promptly and dynamically So far most of our cases have either been imported from China or can be traced to imported cases When we discover them we have isolated the patients done contact tracing and quarantined close contacts This has contained the spread and helped stamp out several local clusters But in the last few days we have seen some cases which cannot be traced to the source of infection These worried us because it showed that the virus is probably already circulating in our own population This is why we raised the Dorscon Disease Outbreak Response System Condition to orange yesterday and are stepping up measures We are reducing mingling in schools We are tightening up access to our hospitals We are taking extra precautions at large public events have already postponed my Chinese New Year Istana Garden Party for grassroots leaders which was to be held tomorrow We have raised Dorscon to orange before You may not remember but this was in for the N swine flu So there is no need to panic We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home We have ample supplies so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles tinned food or toilet paper as some people did yesterday Whatever the situation we can each do our part One observe personal hygiene wash your hands often and avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily Two take your temperature twice daily And three if you are not well please avoid crowded places and see doctor immediately These simple steps do not take much effort but if we all do them they will go long way towards containing the spread of the virus Right now we are continuing to do contact tracing and to quarantine close contacts But expect to see more cases with no known contacts in the coming days If the numbers keep growing at some point we will have to reconsider our strategy If the virus is widespread it is futile to try to trace every contact If we still hospitalise and isolate every suspect case our hospitals will be overwhelmed At that point provided that the fatality rate stays low like flu we should shift our approach Encourage those who only have mild symptoms to see their family GP and rest at home instead of going to the hospital and let hospitals and healthcare workers focus on the most vulnerable patients the elderly young children and those with medical complications We are not at that point yet It may or may not happen but we are thinking ahead and anticipating the next few steps And am sharing these possibilities with you so that we are all mentally prepared for what may come am confident of the medical outcome of this outbreak Most Singaporeans should remain well and of those who get ill most should expect to recover Among those who have been hospitalised so far most are stable or improving Several have already recovered and been discharged although few remain in critical condition But the real test is to our social cohesion and psychological resilience Fear and anxiety are natural human reactions We all want to protect ourselves and our families from what is still new and unknown disease But fear can do more harm than the virus itself It can make us panic or do things which make matters worse like circulating rumours online hoarding facemasks or food or blaming particular groups for the outbreak We should take courage and see through this stressful time together That is in fact what many Singaporeans are doing Grassroots leaders and Team Nila volunteers have stepped forward to help distribute masks to households University students are delivering food daily to schoolmates confined to their dorms on leave of absence Healthcare workers are on the front line treating patients in hospitals and clinics and helping them get well again Business federations unions public transport workers are going the extra mile to maintain services take care of workers and keep Singapore running They are inspirations to all of us This is what it means to be Singaporean This is who we are Let us stay united and resolute in this new coronavirus outbreak Take sensible precautions help one another stay calm and carry on with our lives ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
fkes1xt,So people downvoted snufflufikist for asking for sources but he made good point the math is only as good as the assumptions you put in there and think there are some flaws in yours First your assumption that will require ventilation is likely false We know that based on the largest Chinese study https jamanetwork com journals jama fullarticle defined as people with shortness of breath and blood oxygen levels of lt These people will likely need some supplementary oxygen But DO NOT need ventilation were considered critical admitted to the ICU From another study https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa we know that about half of the ICU patients of total patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation You re likely looking at Italy which has said that about in patients require intensive care not necessarily invasive mechanical ventilation and this ignores the fact that Italy population is twice as old as Canada Second you assume that only ventilators will be available Currently https secure cihi ca free products ICU Report EN pdf ventilators are being used for whole host of issues which include as result of planned ICU admissions or accidents If this truly infects of the population at once some of those activities that could result in ventilation will be curbed making more ventilators available Which bring me to third assuming that of the Canadian population will be infected This figure is based on pandemic model https nationalpost com news canada coronavirus could infect to per cent of canadian population experts say and does not necessarily represent the most plausible scenario The high end assumes no public health intervention which isn the case here so we can throw that right out The is if there is modest intervention Insofar as we have even more intervention which think what is happening now with school closures and limiting of gatherings then the will drop even more Fourth the will not be infected all at once We have yet to see country get anywhere close to that level of population infection so it hard to say how long it would take but it would certainly take some time For arguments sake let say year The maths So putting it all together of the population infected people needing ventilation Avg days on ventilator We don know but the median hospital stay is days of those in severe condition so let use that Number of ventilators available at point in time unknown due to reasons noted above but let say Number of ventilators available over year So IF of the population gets infected and IF it only takes year to do that two pretty big IFs and IF we can only allocate ventilators then the likely death count would be Which is lot but don believe that it will ever get to that ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
fiox3jz,The race is on to find out how the deadly coronavirus jumped from animals to humans Helen Briggs looks at how scientists are trying to trace the source of the outbreak Somewhere in China bat flits across the sky leaving trace of coronavirus in its droppings which fall to the forest floor wild animal possibly pangolin snuffling for insects among the leaves picks up the infection from the excrement The novel virus circulates in wildlife Eventually an infected animal is captured and person somehow catches the disease then passes it on to workers at wildlife market global outbreak is born Scientists are attempting to prove the truth of this scenario as they work to find wild animals harbouring the virus Finding the sequence of events is bit of detective story says Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society London ZSL range of wild animal species could be the host he says in particular bats which harbour large number of different coronaviruses So how much do we know about the spillover event as it known in the trade When scientists cracked the code of the new virus taken from the body of patient bats in China were implicated The mammals gather in large colonies fly long distances and are present on every continent They rarely get sick themselves but have the opportunity to spread pathogens far and wide According to Prof Kate Jones of University College London there is some evidence bats have adapted to the energetic demands of flight and are better at repairing DNA damage This might enable them to cope with higher burden of viruses before getting sick but this is just an idea at present There no doubt that the behaviour of bats allows viruses to thrive When you consider the very way that they live then they are going to have large array of viruses says Prof Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham And because they re mammals there a possibility that some of them can infect humans either directly or through an intermediate host species The second part of the puzzle then is the identify of the mystery animal that incubated the virus in its body and possibly ended up in the market at Wuhan One suspect for the smoking gun is the pangolin The ant devouring scaly mammal said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world is threatened with extinction The animal scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine while pangolin meat is considered delicacy by some Coronaviruses have been found in pangolins some claimed to be close match to the novel human virus Could the bat virus and pangolin virus have traded genetics before spreading to humans Experts are cautious about drawing any conclusions Full data on the pangolin study has not been released making the information impossible to verify Prof Cunningham says the provenance and number of pangolins examined for the research is especially important For example were there multiple animals sampled directly in the wild in which case the results would be more meaningful or was single animal from captive environment or wet market sampled in which case conclusions about the true host of the virus could not be robustly made Pangolins and other wild species including variety of species of bat are often sold in wet markets he says providing opportunities for viruses to move from one species to another Wet markets therefore create ideal conditions for the spillover of pathogens from one species to another including to people The market in Wuhan which was closed down after the outbreak had wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were on sale including body parts of camels koalas and birds The Guardian reports that an inventory at one shop listed live wolf pups golden cicadas scorpions bamboo rats squirrels foxes civets hedgehogs probably porcupines salamanders turtles and crocodiles As far as we know bats and pangolins weren listed but authorities in China will have intelligence on what animals were being sold says Prof Ball If the spillover happened once you want to know whether or not this sort of thing can happen again because it important from public health standpoint he says And so you need to know exactly what species of animal it in and also what were the risks that gave rise to that spillover event Many of the viruses we have become familiar with in recent years have crossed over from wild animals This is the story of Ebola HIV Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars and now coronavirus Prof Jones says the rise in infectious disease events from wildlife might be because of our increasing ability to detect them growing connectivity to each other or more encroachment into wild habitats thereby changing landscapes and coming into contact with new viruses the human population hasn seen before If we understand the risk factors we can take steps to prevent it happening in the first place without adversely affecting wild animals says Prof Cunningham Conservationists are at pains to point out that although bats are thought to carry many viruses they are also essential for ecosystems to function Insectivorous bats eat huge volumes of insects such as mosquitoes and agricultural pests while fruit bats pollinate trees and spread their seeds he says It is imperative that these species are not culled through misguided disease control measures After Sars in caused by very similar coronavirus to the one now emerging in China and beyond there was temporary ban on wild animal markets But the markets quickly sprang up again across China Vietnam and other parts of south east Asia China has again suspended the buying and selling of wild animal products which are commonly used for food fur and in traditional medicines Reports suggest this may be made permanent While we may never know exactly how or where the disease responsible for many deaths made the leap into humans Prof Diana Bell of the University of East Anglia says we can prevent another perfect storm We are bringing together animals from different countries different habitats different lifestyles in terms of aquatic animals arboreal animals and so on and mixing them together and it a kind of melting pot and we ve got to stop doing it ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fkqjxrl,The report doesn really recommend only suppression either suppression either It basically says that there no good solution but that mixture of the will probably be required What you quoted is definitely in their but it not the whole picture Apologies for the wall of quotes below but think that these are the most relevant parts of the report gt The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission will need to be maintained until vaccine becomes available potentially months or more given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed gt To avoid rebound in transmission these policies will need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine are available to immunise the population which could be months or more gt Once interventions are relaxed in the example in Figure from September onwards infections begin to rise resulting in predicted peak epidemic later in the year The more successful strategy is at temporary suppression the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination due to lesser build up of herd immunity gt The choice of interventions ultimately depends on the relative feasibility of their implementation and their likely effectiveness in different social contexts gt However there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this virus the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviours This means it is difficult to be definitive about the likely initial duration of measures which will be required except that it will be several months Future decisions on when and for how long to relax policies will need to be informed by ongoing surveillance gt Long term suppression may not be feasible policy option in many countries Our results show that the alternative relatively short term month mitigation policy option might reduce deaths seen in the epidemic by up to half and peak healthcare demand by two thirds gt However we emphasise that is not at all certain that suppression will succeed long term no public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such long duration of time How populations and societies will respond remains unclear Then the only paragraphs that anyone is discussing gt Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over In the most effective mitigation strategy examined which leads to single relatively short epidemic case isolation household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly the surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least fold under the more optimistic scenario for critical care requirements that we examined In addition even if all patients were able to be treated we predict there would still be in the order of deaths in GB and million in the US gt In the UK this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID based on experience in Italy and the UK previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity gt We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time The social and economic effects of the measures which are needed to achieve this policy goal will be profound Many countries have adopted such measures already but even those countries at an earlier stage of their epidemic such as the UK will need to do so imminently The actual recommendation appears to be gt Given suppression policies may need to be maintained for many months we examined the impact of an adaptive policy in which social distancing plus school and university closure if used is only initiated after weekly confirmed case incidence in ICU patients group of patients highly likely to be tested exceeds certain on threshold and is relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below certain off threshold Figure Case based policies of home isolation of symptomatic cases and household quarantine if adopted are continued throughout ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fju2z95,Coronavirus If the emergency continues forced to select access to ICU by age and based on higher life expectancy Document of anesthesiologists resuscitators March All put in black on white in Recommendations prepared by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care for which we are substantially in situation comparable to that of disaster medicine It is scenario in which criteria for access to intensive care and discharge may be necessary not only strictly of clinical appropriateness and proportionality of care but also inspired by criterion as shared as possible of distributive justice and appropriate allocation of limited health resources THE DOCUMENT In the face of the current epidemic of the new Coronavirus and forecasts that estimate for the next few weeks in many centers an increase in cases of acute respiratory insufficiency with the need for ICU admission of such magnitude as to determine an enormous imbalance between the real clinical needs of the population and the effective availability of intensive resources it may be necessary to place an age limit on entry into TI and it is not question of making merely valuable choices but of reserving resources that could be very scarce for those who it has first of all more chances of survival and secondly to those who can have more years of life saved with view to maximizing the benefits for the greatest number of people And again in scenario of total saturation of intensive resources deciding to maintain first come first served criterion would still amount to choosing not to treat any subsequent patients who would remain excluded from the Intensive Care The Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care Siaarti wrote it in document released today entitled Recommendations of clinical ethics for admission to intensive treatments and for their suspension in exceptional conditions of imbalance between needs and available resources In all recommendations which include different areas from the flexibility of the criteria to the management of comorbidities from the presence of advance treatment declarations DAT to the inadequacy of the treatments which Siaarti has decided to disclose in full and without any restrictions while being addressed to colleagues and experts As Siaarti reads note we believe it is important and essential in such dramatic moment as the one we are going through because of COVID to offer authoritative professional and scientific support to those forced by daily events to make decisions to difficult and painful times For Siaarti the situation we are experiencing is substantially similar to the field of disaster medicine for which ethical reflection has over time developed many concrete indications for doctors and nurses engaged in difficult choices It is scenario the Scientific Society underlines in which criteria of access to intensive care and of discharge may be necessary not only strictly of clinical appropriateness and proportionality of the care but also inspired by criterion as shared as possible of distributive justice and appropriate allocation of limited health resources In such complex situation Siaarti underlines every doctor may find himself having to make lacerating decisions from an ethical as well as clinical point of view in short time which patients undergo intensive treatments when the resources are not sufficient for all patients that arrive not all with the same chance of recovery read places with special characteristics available in areas that cannot be expanded in short time net that their number can currently be supported by converted operating rooms by blocking the surgical activity The document gives priority to greater life expectancy This implies underline the resuscitating anesthesiologists of not necessarily having to follow criterion of access to intensive care of the first come first served type Although the Recommendations keep in mind that the application of rationing criteria is justifiable only after all possible efforts have been made by all the parties involved to increase the availability of resources available in this case care beds Intensive and after any possibility of transferring patients to treatment centers with greater availability of resources was evaluated The Recommendations points out Siaarti are the result of collective work that brings together national legislation national and international experiences scientific clinical and assistance references deeply intertwined with the reflections of ethics in emergency situations We are aware the anesthesiologists resuscitators still write that tackling this issue can be morally and emotionally difficult and that as Scientific Society we could tacitly entrust everything to the common sense sensitivity and experience of the individual HR or try as we have chosen to do to illuminate the decision making process with this small support that could contribute to reducing anxiety stress and above all the sense of solitude In addition to representing protection for the patient in terms of limiting the arbitrariness of the choices of the treating team But it is not Siaarti with this Document of Recommendations that proposes to treat some patients and to limit treatments to others On the contrary concludes the Scientific Society it is the emergency events that are forcing the anesthesiologists resuscitators to focus attention on the appropriateness of the treatments towards those who can benefit most where the resources are not sufficient for all patients ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fg5msbm,From link part of The next epidemic is now here we ll soon know the costs imposed by the Trump administration early negligence and present panic On Jan Trump announced the creation of the President Coronavirus Task Force an all male group of dozen advisors five from the White House staff Chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar the task force includes men from the CDC State Department DHS the Office of Management and Budget and the Transportation Department It not clear how this task force will function or when it will even convene In the absence of formal structure the government has resorted to improvisation In practical terms the S government public health effort is led by Daniel Jernigan the incident commander for the Wuhan coronavirus response at the CDC Jernigan is responsible for convening meetings of the nation state health commissioners and briefing CDC Director Robert Redfield and his boss Azar Meanwhile state level health leaders told me that they have been sharing information with one another and deciding how best to prepare their medical and public health workers without waiting for instructions from federal leadership The most important federal program for local medical worker and hospital epidemic training however will run out of money in May as Congress has failed to vote on its funding The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response ASPR is the bulwark between hospitals and health departments versus pandemic threats last year HHS requested billion but Congress did not act On Thursday the CDC confirmed the first human to human spread of the Wuhan coronavirus inside the United States between husband and wife in Chicago While the wife acquired her infection traveling in China she passed the virus to her husband on return to the United States Though only six Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the United States with no deaths Nancy Messonnier of the CDC told reporters on Thursday Moving forward we can expect to see more cases and more cases mean the potential for more person to person spread As the number of coronavirus cases increases Americans are growing more fearful which is creating new problems that the government is leaving unaddressed Surveying the largest drug store chains in New York City on Wednesday found that all were sold out of medical face masks and latex gloves as is Amazon Searching online for protective masks reveals that dozens of products intended for use to block dust and particles far larger than viruses are garnering brisk sales and none available that can actually prevent viral exposure The surge in mask and glove sales to worried citizens all over the world needs refereeing Bona fide anti viral masks should be prioritized to front line medical and public health staff and the populace shouldn be misled into purchasing and wearing products that offer no genuine protection Countering misinformation conspiracy theories rumormongering and discriminatory behavior against people believed to be disease spreaders requires thoughtful communication from leadership at the highest levels of government None is in evidence Instead Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared on Fox Business on Thursday to fan the flames of fear for the sake of hypothetical business opportunities It does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain Ross said It another risk factor that people need to take into account So think it will help accelerate the return of jobs to North America some to the S probably some to Mexico as well Meanwhile Trump asked at the recent World Economic Forum gathering in Davos Switzerland how he intended to respond to the epidemic said the situation was under control and world away from the United States In statement released this week Pompeo sought to calm Americans saying People should know that there are enormous efforts underway by the United States government to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the American people and to reduce the risk all around the globe But late Thursday night the secretary in clear defiance of WHO admonishment against restricting travel to and from China issued an advisory saying Those currently in China should consider departing In recent days handful of policy leaders have been shifted from government positions focused on weapons of mass destruction and bioterrorism to the slowly emerging epidemic response infrastructure such as Matthew Pottinger Philip Ferro and David Wade on the NSC and the bioterrorism expert Anthony Ruggiero It not at all clear how they would handle an explosion of coronavirus cases were such dreadful thing to occur in the United States The full weight of the US Government is working on this senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday As with any interagency effort of this scale the National Security Council works closely with the whole of government to ensure coordinated and unified effort The last time the S government and its many local and state counterparts faced an explosive pandemic on American soil was with the spread of N or swine flu The then new Obama administration was still filling key positions across the executive branch when the epidemic emerged that spring and it struggled to set the proper tone in reaction to what turned out to be an exceptionally contagious but not unusually virulent form of influenza The challenge revealed enormous gaps in America ability to swiftly manufacture vaccines stock outs of face masks and vital hospital supplies and serious difficulty in keeping ahead of outright lies conspiracy theories and rumormongering on cable TV and social media The much more deadly pandemic test came in with the arrival of HIV It did not go well as history has well established because homophobia was so pervasive in the country and within government that gay men rather than the virus killing them were treated as national scourge Since the great influenza pandemic of the United States has been spared terrifying epidemics Americans now are epidemic voyeurs They watch YouTube videos of China struggles They see the government attack its epidemic by building bed quarantine hospital in single week lock down cities larger than New York or Los Angeles ramp up manufacture of face masks and protective gear deploy its armed forces medical corps to treat ailing citizens send enormous convoys of food and supplies to anxious citizens of Wuhan and release terrifying growing tallies daily of its swelling patient populations They look in horror at panicked lines of masked people waiting to learn if their fevers are caused by the deadly disease at bodies lying on cold floors in overcrowded hospitals and at people crying out from behind their masks for help And they ask What would the United States do What would the White House do The answers are not reassuring

fhpr14i,In Chinese http www qstheory cn dukan qs htm Wanted to be like Mao Be careful what you wish for comrade Speech at the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the People Republic of China during work on the response to the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic Source Seeking Truth Author Xi Jinping Study responses at the Standing Committee of the Politburo Speech at work on new

that we must attach great importance to the epidemic do our best to prevent and control it and require party committees governments and relevant departments at all levels to put the safety and health of the people first Take effective measures to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic On January in view of the rapid spread of the epidemic and the severe challenges of prevention and control explicitly requested Hubei Province to implement comprehensive and strict control over the outflow of personnel On the first day of the first month once again presided over meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to re examine re deploy and mobilize the epidemic prevention and control especially patient treatment and decided to set up central leadership team for epidemic response From the first day of the year to the present prevention and control of the epidemic situation is my most concerned issue keep track of the spread of the epidemic situation and the progress of the prevention and control work and continue to give oral instructions and instructions The Party Central Committee issued the Notice on Strengthening the Party Leadership and Providing Strong Political Guarantee for Winning the Fight Against Epidemic Prevention and Control The Central Leadership Group for Epidemic Response has met several times to study and deploy epidemic prevention and control work and the front steering group has also actively carried out its work The State Council joint prevention and control mechanism has strengthened coordination and scheduling to coordinate and resolve urgent issues encountered in prevention and control work in timely manner Relevant departments perform their duties and the military actively supports local epidemic prevention and control Leading groups in charge of comrades in charge of the party and government have been established in various regions and Level responses to major public health emergencies have been initiated The various government military and army organs and enterprises and institutions took urgent action and fought hard The selfless dedication and bravery of the medical staff the broad masses of the people and the city united and fought together The situation of comprehensive mobilization comprehensive deployment and comprehensive strengthening of epidemic prevention and control has taken shape across the country Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and the joint efforts of all parties the prevention and control work is being vigorously carried out and all sectors of society and international public opinion are generally good When met with the Director General of the World Health Organization Tan Desai Tan Desai said that the speed and scale of China action are rare and the world is rare This is China institutional advantage The relevant experience is worth learning from other countries Measures will effectively control and eventually overcome the epidemic On February Xi Jinping General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee State President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission investigated and guided the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Beijing This is Xi Jinping investigation at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chaoyang District Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Bin photo In general the Central Committee judgment on the epidemic situation is accurate all work arrangements are timely and the measures adopted are also effective Now the most critical issue is to work hard carefully and to the ground Let me highlight few points On the situation of epidemic prevention and control and key tasks of epidemic prevention and control Doing good job in epidemic prevention and control directly affects the safety of people lives and physical health and directly affects the stability of the overall economic and social situation It also has bearing on China opening up We must do good job in accordance with the requirements of firm confidence mutual help scientific control and precise policy race at the same time and fight against the disease resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic and resolutely win the battle against epidemic prevention and control At present we must focus on the following tasks in epidemic prevention and control On February Xi Jinping General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee State President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission investigated and guided the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Beijing This is Xi Jinping remote diagnosis and treatment center at Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University He used video to connect to Jinyintan Hospital Xiehe Hospital and Vulcan Mountain Hospital in Wuhan to treat patients with new coronary pneumonia to understand the situation listen to opinions and suggestions and console first line medical workers Xinhua News Agency reporter Xie Huanchi photo First strengthen unified leadership of epidemic prevention and control To prevent and control the epidemic we must adhere to national chess game Party committees and governments at all levels must resolutely obey the unified command coordination and dispatch of the party central committee to ensure that orders are prohibited At present the implementation of the Party Central Committee decision making and deployment in all regions and departments is generally good but there are also some weak links and issues worth noting We must make up for shortcomings and plug loopholes Epidemic prevention and control is not only medical and health issue but comprehensive work is general battle and all work must provide support to win the battle against epidemic prevention and control The situation of epidemic prevention and control is constantly changing and various tasks are constantly faced with new situations and new problems We must follow closely analyze in timely manner act quickly and do our work firmly and unswervingly When adopting prevention and control measures in various regions and departments it is necessary to consider both the prevention and control needs of the region and its area as well as the impact on key areas and national prevention and control Those who fail to implement the decision making arrangements of the Party Central Committee must dare to criticize and order them to rectify immediately For those who do not obey unified command and dispatch serious standardism and those who dare not to assume responsibility drift in style and ridicule others in addition to investigating the responsibilities of those directly responsible they must also hold the party and government leaders accountable for serious circumstances Those who fail to perform their duties shall be punished according to discipline and law Second strengthen epidemic prevention and control in key areas Only by focusing on controlling the epidemic situation in key areas can we fundamentally reverse the spread of the epidemic nationwide as soon as possible It is necessary to focus on regional coordination of prevention and control forces resolutely focus rescue and protection resources on the front line of fighting the epidemic and give priority to meeting the needs of frontline medical staff and treating patients Hubei Province especially Wuhan City is still the top priority of national epidemic prevention and control and most patients in other places also have contact history in Hubei Having stabilized the epidemic in Hubei the overall situation of the country was stabilized On the one hand we must continue to comprehensively strengthen prevention and control strictly implement early detection early reporting early quarantine and early treatment measures across the province strengthen epidemic surveillance focus on treating patients and take home medical observations of all close contacts On the other hand we must continue to strengthen measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic Civil aviation railways highways and water passenger transportation in Hubei have been closed This has played an important role in controlling the epidemic throughout the country but the risks caused by the outflow of some personnel cannot be ignored ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
fla0yns,I am simply explaining to you that you will not be allowed to recline before understanding your responsibility The current press conference about the south Korean tests is not what talked about talked about the Danish firm that had been offering for week Actually called the hospital in slagelse last week because they said publicly that they needed goggles When called them they said they had gotten enough for the day so they didn need any more You just say Denmark is handling this well because you want to live in good country everybody wishes but you have to get back to reality now Your parents generation have taught you that you can look away from what happens to other people and you have to be more informed that they were You won convince anybody that killing with the flu is different than killing with gas chambers didn say those two things connect like that we clearly took half our emergency plan directly on orders from the CCP but that wasn what we were talking about The poll said that people didn take it seriously Separately from that then argued that even if denmark refuse to understand how the virus kills people you can actually think for yourself still Denmark counts lots of mortality like that that is why no psychiatric patient ever dies from overdosing on pharmaceutical drugs in dk But in the case of the SARS virus we are expected to provide clear numbers to the WHO and therefore we are forced to take tests on dead people and put them up as numbers with growing number of to explain how this fit into our normal Danish habits XD You said we did but the problem is then you ignore that the first man was tested after death because somebody was ordered to test dead people Which means there was time before we ordered to test dead people as well Then we kept that man from the statistics for several days and the pressure to include him was finally enough to have him in the statistics But you wanna sit here and tell the world that we happily included him into our statistics That man was resting cold on slap in the morgue while we debated to never report him to WHO and put in to make sure we don say he actually died from coronavirus and you wanna say online that we report everything because you want to feel that your country will do the right thing will remind you of my shot shot shot math that did for you earlier because the military will end up patrolling your streets if all keep pretending that you just don understand what is expected of you now Okay won call you kid you are bot troll army you really just sit in Russian army compound where you go to work everyday writing weird stuff about other countries you don know what you are talking about even You clearly do not keep updated with what is happening in denmark and as said your level of responsibility will determine if you are held accountable for parts of the total accumulated death toll after all of this You can kick jump and scream it is not my problem how you feel when confronted with the truth but will refrain from calling you kid and just refer to you as Russian troll in the future ,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fkgdm2x,I heard about the herd immunity thing which is downright dangerous and gambling with peoples lives They don even know if it will work Sadly UK is not far behind the US in outbreak severity yet they are not included in the recent travel ban Trump Travel bans are joke and misleading they are more like travel restrictions since flights are still going back and forth between all the countries besides Iran for unrelated reasons and maybe now Italy because of their country wide lockdown So many Americans are still stupidly flying back and forth to high outbreaks areas and bringing it back here Trump pats himself on the back every chance he gets to remind us that he implemented early travel bans that saved the US and bought us time And he hasn taken much action to help the America people after that besides lots of big talk show and downplaying He put Mike Pence someone with no experience related to pandemics in charge of the pandemic team Then he made all experts required to go through him before public speaking so experts and officials don contradict each other anymore Then Trump ordered all coronavirus meetings confidential The opposite of transparency and clarity what citizens wanted The rest of my comment is very long you don have to read it My original comment got deleted before could post it so retyped what could remember but it not as well put together as the first time typed it m highly critical of the US government embarrassing response to the pandemic They had months of warning to prepare the country for pandemic yet barely took any preventative actions and they so far have barely done anything to contain it Instead they downplayed and mislead the public pretended everything is fine nothing to see here and blatantly contradicted expert opinions Mainstream media and officials almost completely hid anything related to the virus up until two weeks ago so most Americans didn even know about or care about the virus The Italy outbreak was the catalyst to few events that forced the US and other western countries to acknowledge the virus only once it was too large to ignore They launched misinformation and lie campaign against the American public hiding important information on how to best protect ourselves how the virus works and how severe it truly is They perpetuate the dangerous it just the flu mindset that will go on to be main spread of the virus People think the flu is worse so they don bother to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and further spread the virus everywhere while carrying on with their every day lives with their vacations and cruises They encouraged people to attend large events and gatherings like parades and celebrations They tell us don buy masks they are ineffective for civilians unless you are sick But masks are crucial for medical professionals which goes against common sense and various studies What they really mean is masks are ineffective if not worn properly and if not the proper mask for the situation But they lie and make it dangerous for the rest of who don blindly believe them ve become target every time leave the house for wearing respirator and PPE being ridiculed and treated like have the plague am Asian but in my case think it has less to do with xenophobia and more to do with the rampant mask misinformation the public has been brainwashed with Officials and media just say wash your hands and you ll be fine which doesn do much when the virus is airborne And that another thing they have never acknowledged that it airborne despite the fact that the WHO relayed this on February th and believe China stated this prior to that What really baffles me is lack of attention paid to some of the unprecedented actions taken to stop the virus China quarantined million people and shut down their economy for months Why would they take such drastic measures if this virus were just the flu and not big deal This and so many other warnings came from China yet little to no preparation was taken The US government claim their top priority is American societal health but they could have fooled me They protect corporations and the economy and the market over people Did you know corporations have some of the same human rights as citizens Sounds like joke right There a group of huge corporations who own and control everything including the US government They were molded and have thrived via late stage capitalism the cancer of the modern world Over the last few months relating to this pandemic there have been countless decisions made where thought this can be real That doesn make sense Is this actually happening But it all makes sense when you think about it in terms of them doing what in their best interest which is corporate interest and not societal health That why officials announced bailouts for large industries like airlines travel before announcing any real help for the average citizen huge and glaring issue has been testing which has been disaster here Widespread testing is still almost non existent here US CDC messed up the first batch of test kits which delayed testing and meanwhile the virus spread undetected for several weeks As of last week individual States finally have the ability to test however there aren enough tests and testing capability is low with many labs They lie and say anyone can be tested But average citizens have to jump through hoops and practically beg for chance to be tested ve read several stories of people being denied testing because they aren sick enough and must be in respiratory failure to qualify Meanwhile in places like South Korea they test thousands per day and implement drive through testing to limit viral transmission among many other things But here crowds of people cram into hospitals for chance to be tested spreading the virus even more Some Billionaires are even stepping in where our government has failed by helping with expanding testing Schools have threatened kids with legal trouble if they have too many absences People are afraid to miss work while sick because they may be threatened and fired by their employer So they show up to work sick and infect everyone else Or they live paycheck to paycheck and or don have sick leave and can afford to miss work or they lose their home Many people are also afraid of the costs associated with testing and treatment which could bankrupt many so they avoid it Meanwhile in China they covered all expenses for testing and treatment Meanwhile in Italy they halted mortgages during the quarantine so people don have to worry about losing their homes USA global super power Most pandemic prepared country and richest country in the world has barely done anything to protect their own people Officials have talked big but not taken much action or done much else On local level officials are doing little more but it not enough Everything is way too little way too late It embarrassing and is already proving to be deadly This pandemic is helping expose flaws with our country On another note am glad that other countries are watching what happens to us and other heavily infected countries and using it as glimpse into their possible future and instead taking early aggressive preventative actions to fight the pandemic and help their own people At least they still have chance Aggressive measures and working together might be the only chance to stop this virus now So many people have died and gotten very sick when lot of this could ve been prevented How many more people have to die for certain governments to take action and protect the citizens This has been long Best of luck to you and wish you great health in the upcoming difficult times ,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
fl27mae,You haven provided any sources you just pasted in some text You could have made it up for all know One definitely remember seeing with my own eyes was Boris was on Good Morning Breakfast and talked about something that sounds very like herd immunity in an interview that was covered by FullFact here https fullfact org health boris johnson coronavirus this morning He doesn call it herd immunity but he probably knows his audience and probably didn know the term himself he just knew it killed off few poor old sods and business could keep chugging away That was th March according to the article So ve looked for the source of your quoted text and it appears to be this https www theatlantic com health archive coronavirus pandemic herd immunity uk boris johnson https www theatlantic com health archive coronavirus pandemic herd immunity uk boris johnson ll have look to see if there anything of interest The sub heading isn great and reflects your quote from Petra Klepac gt The country is not aiming for percent of the populace to get COVID but you be forgiven for thinking so based on how badly the actual plan has been explained This one isn great no date in the text but the Sky interview seems to be from March gt To avoid second peak in the winter Vallance said the K would suppress the virus but not get rid of it completely while focusing on protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly In the meantime other people would get sick But since the virus causes milder illness in younger age groups most would recover and subsequently be immune to the virus This herd immunity would reduce transmission in the event of winter resurgence On Sky News https www youtube com watch XRc TvG Vallance said that probably about percent of people would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity This Financial Times th March headline about the interview doesn sound great gt UK chief scientific adviser defends herd immunity strategy https www ft com content ea f fe ea This quote from the above source does seem to indicate that they were going for herd immunity at the time gt In another interview with the BBC Sir Patrick said If you suppress something very very hard when you release those measures it bounces back and it bounces back at the wrong time gt gt He added Our aim is to try to reduce the peak broaden the peak not suppress it completely also because the vast majority of people get mild illness to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it He actually said Our aim is to build up some kind of herd immunity Our aim Sounds like something you have in strategy This part of your quote from the source gave isn great either gt In interviews Vallance and others certainly made it sound like the government was deliberately aiming for percent of the populace to fall ill Keep calm and carry on and get COVID There another article from the Guardian lefty remoaners know about the herd immunity strategy wonder where they got that idea from with nice title gt Herd immunity will the UK coronavirus strategy work https www theguardian com world mar herd immunity will the uks coronavirus strategy work This was again an article from the th Here a quote from another of the experts gt Dr David Halpern psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team said on BBC News There going to be point assuming the epidemic flows and grows as we think it probably will do where you ll want to cocoon you ll want to protect those at risk groups so that they basically don catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning herd immunity been achieved in the rest of the population That seems to match up to what said It certainly sounds like it was the strategy So it sounds like it was the strategy on the th March and it definitely was an aim of something that might have been strategy up until the th The seemed to be few journalists who thought herd immunity was part of the strategy and these scientists also seem to have to got the dumb idea from somewhere in the below which is meant to be used as source of scientific quotes for the media gt https www sciencemediacentre org expert comments about herd immunity https www sciencemediacentre org expert comments about herd immunity So you have Boris Patrick Vallance David Halpern and fair few other scientists who seem to think that herd immunity was part of the strategy and even an aim of the strategy up until and including March One of your quoted experts mentions herd immunity on the th in tweet https twitter com petrakle status also gt BUT if you relax intervention measures before you reach heard immunity while you still have enough susceptible people around the infections will increase as you can see in the red curve Can we sustain the measures long enough to avoid pushing the peak to next winter She has nice chart with lines with the tweet also which you can see above in the tweet link think she or someone else can tell deleted the first tweet in the thread so can really follow what she is discussing don think she is advocating herd immunity as part of strategy in this chain of tweets unlike Patrick Valance On the th there was another tweets thread https twitter com AdamJKucharski status from Adam Kucharski which includes the below ve added the emphasis in bold gt am deeply uncomfortable with the message that UK is actively pursuing herd immunity as the main COVID strategy Our group scenario modelling has focused on reducing two main things peak healthcare demand and deaths So he seems to think that was the message going out Another is again ve added emphasis in bold gt For me herd immunity has never been the outright aim it been tragic consequence of having virus that based on current evidence is unlikely to be fully controllable in long term in the UK So him wasn an aim which differs from Patrick Vallance who aims included to build up some kind of herd immunity There was also few WHO messages that went out over this weekend too but am getting bit bored now so can be bothered to source it am not sure what date Imperial suddenly found data from Italy that had been around from February that they used in their modelling published the week after but would guess it was around this time also Hancock spoke on Sunday th according to you quote from the source provided above m fairly sure something happened between the th and the th Maybe the UK government and scientific experts realised that saying that herd immunity was an aim of your strategy when it wasn was bad idea Maybe they realised that having it as an aim of your strategy and thinking that it might be good thing to try to achieve was terrible idea don know really know the true answer do know that they were going around talking about it like it was part of their strategy for couple of weeks and then all of sudden it was nonsense and not part of their strategy at all If it wasn part of their strategy then it is an example of very bad scientific communication If it was part of their strategy and they delayed introducing mitigation and suppression measures then don even really want to finish this sentence ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
fi0md3s, gt The question ve been asking since If the experts are going to claim particular virus causes particular disease how do they know that virus exists in the first place gt For example the supposedly new coronavirus in China For example Ebola For example HIV For example the coronavirus supposedly causing SARS How do researchers know these viruses exist gt Well of course they know They must gt That is not satisfactory answer even though most people would offer it gt The question can become very interesting when you stop and consider researchers working away in biowarfare labs fiddling with viruses How do they know they re tweaking viruses that actually exist gt On more mundane frontier when scientists tell us they re rushing to develop vaccine against virus that is harming the population how do they know that virus exists to begin with gt came to this question when was researching HIV in began to think about it seriously in During all these years ve reached out to independent researchers and ve tried to stitch together their answers can say it been smooth trip gt But have found some answers and have certainly found some fake mainstream assertions which glitter like baubles on plastic branches of cent store Xmas trees gt Here are few clues You need to take tissue sample from live human being You need to filter that sample correctly so you arrive at much smaller sample you believe might contain virus You need to put drop of that sample under an electron microscope and observe what looks like virus gt How much virus How many identical particles of virus Opinions differ on this It could be one definite virus one particle It could be many many identical particles gt Sidebar If you re trying to prove this virus is actually causing DISEASE in person you have to go further You have to show the very same virus is active and replicating at very high rate in the person body and his immune system isn defeating it Beyond noticing the patient is sick how do you test for all THAT m still looking for definitive technical answer if there is one gt All right let get back to the electron microscope Let say you ve observed many identical particles of what looks like virus in the electron microscope photograph called an EM You can then say Found it But you need to be sure You need to figure out that this virus isn just something that ordinarily lives in the human body like couch potato and does nothing passive endogenous virus No You want to show this virus comes from the outside as an invader an exogenous virus And how do you perfectly make that differentiation every time Another question that might have no precise formula as an answer gt Big question CAN WE BE SURE ALL VIRUSES THAT ARE SAID TO EXIST AND SAID TO CAUSE EPIDEMICS ARE ACTUALLY FOUND AND OBSERVED AND IDENTIFIED ON ELECTRON MICROSCOPE PHOTOGRAPHS CAN WE AT LEAST SAY THAT gt No gt In which case the researchers have been at least some of the time up the creek without paddle They ve jumped the gun They ve bolted out of the starting gate too soon They ve laid their money down on horse that may not even be in the race They ve written check no one can cash They re

fg8p63h,Article Part As New Coronavirus Spread China Old Habits Delayed Fight At critical turning points Chinese authorities put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis and risking public alarm or political embarrassment WUHAN China mysterious illness had stricken seven patients at hospital and doctor tried to warn his medical school classmates Quarantined in the emergency department the doctor Li Wenliang wrote in an online chat group on Dec referring to patients So frightening one recipient replied before asking about the epidemic that began in China in and ultimately killed nearly people Is SARS coming again In the middle of the night officials from the health authority in the central city of Wuhan summoned Dr Li demanding to know why he had shared the information Three days later the police compelled him to sign statement that his warning constituted illegal behavior The illness was not SARS but something similar coronavirus that is now on relentless march outward from Wuhan throughout the country and across the globe killing at least people in China and infecting more than worldwide The government initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain tenacious hold At critical moments officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment reconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of the first symptoms in early December and the government decision to lock down the city based on two dozen interviews with Wuhan residents doctors and officials on government statements and on Chinese media reports points to decisions that delayed concerted public health offensive In those weeks the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising red flags They played down the dangers to the public leaving the city million residents unaware they should protect themselves They closed food market where the virus was believed to have started but told the public it was for renovations Their reluctance to go public in part played to political motivations as local officials prepared for their annual congresses in January Even as cases climbed officials declared repeatedly that there had likely been no more infections By not moving aggressively to warn the public and medical professionals public health experts say the Chinese government lost one of its best chances to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic This was an issue of inaction said Yanzhong Huang senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China There was no action in Wuhan from the local health department to alert people to the threat The first case the details of which are limited and the specific date unknown was in early December By the time the authorities galvanized into action on Jan the disease had grown into formidable threat It is now global health emergency It has triggered travel restrictions around the world shaken financial markets and created perhaps the greatest challenge yet for China leader Xi Jinping The crisis could upend Mr Xi agenda for months or longer even undermining his vision of political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to iron fisted authoritarianism On the last day of after Dr Li message was shared outside the group the authorities focused on controlling the narrative The police announced that they were investigating eight people for spreading rumors about the outbreak That same day Wuhan health commission its hand forced by those rumors announced that people were suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause Its statement said there was no need to be alarmed The disease is preventable and controllable the statement said Dr Li an ophthalmologist went back to work after being reprimanded On Jan he treated woman for glaucoma He did not know she had already been infected with the coronavirus probably by her daughter They both became sick So would he Hazmat Suits and Disinfectants Hu Xiaohu who sold processed pork in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sensed by late December that something was amiss Workers were coming down with nagging fevers No one knew why but Mr Hu said several were in hospital quarantine The market occupies much of block in newer part of the city sitting incongruously near apartment buildings and shops catering to the growing middle class It is warren of stalls selling meats poultry and fish as well as more exotic fare including live reptiles and wild game that some in China prize as delicacies According to report by the city center for disease control sanitation was dismal with poor ventilation and garbage piled on wet floors In hospitals doctors and nurses were puzzled to see cluster of patients with symptoms of viral pneumonia that did not respond to the usual treatments They soon noticed that many patients had one thing in common They worked in Huanan market On Jan police officers showed up at the market along with public health officials and shut it down Xinhua news agency reported that the market was undergoing renovation but that morning workers in hazmat suits moved in washing out stalls and spraying disinfectants It was for the public the first visible government response to contain the disease The day before on Dec national authorities had alerted the World Health Organization office in Beijing of an outbreak City officials struck optimistic notes in their announcements They suggested they had stopped the virus at its source The cluster of illnesses was limited There was no evidence the virus spread between humans Projecting optimism and confidence if you don have the data is very dangerous strategy said Alexandra Phelan faculty research instructor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University It undermines the legitimacy of the government in messaging she added And public health is dependent on public trust Nine days after the market closed man who shopped there regularly became the first fatality of the disease according to report by the Wuhan Health Commission the agency that oversees public health and sanitation The year old identified by his last name Zeng already had chronic liver disease and tumor in his abdomen and had checked into Wuhan Puren Hospital with raging fever and difficulty breathing The authorities disclosed the man death two days after it happened They did not mention crucial detail in understanding the course of the epidemic Mr Zeng wife had developed symptoms five days after he did She had never visited the market The Race to Identify Killer About miles from the market scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were studying samples from the patients checking into the city hospitals One of the scientists Zheng Li Shi was part of the team that tracked down the origins of the SARS virus which emerged in the southern province of Guangdong in As the public remained largely in the dark about the virus she and her colleagues quickly pieced together that the new outbreak was related to SARS The genetic composition suggested common initial host bats The SARS epidemic began when coronavirus jumped from bats to Asian palm civets catlike creature that is legally raised and consumed It was likely that this new coronavirus had followed similar path possibly somewhere in or on the way to the Huanan market or another market like it Around the same time Dr Li and other medical professionals in Wuhan started trying to provide warnings to colleagues and others when the government did not Lu Xiaohong the head of gastroenterology at City Hospital No told China Youth Daily that she had heard by Dec that the disease was spreading among medical workers full three weeks before the authorities would acknowledge the fact She did not go public with her concerns but privately warned school near another market By the first week of January the emergency ward in Hospital No was filling the cases included members of the same family making it clear that the disease was spreading through human contact which the government had said was not likely No one realized the doctor said that it was as serious as it would become until it was too late to stop it realized that we had underestimated the enemy she said At the Institute of Virology Dr Shi and her colleagues isolated the genetic sequence and the viral strain during the first week of January They used samples from seven of the first patients six of them vendors at the market On Jan the institute scientists gave the new coronavirus its identity and began referring to it by the technical shorthand nCoV Four days later the team shared the virus genetic makeup in public database for scientists everywhere to use That allowed scientists around the world to study the virus and swiftly share their findings As the scientific community moved quickly to devise test for exposure political leaders remained reluctant to act ,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

fkjpk43, Corona seems to go from October to November Hankyore Professor Kim Yun Professor Jung Sik Uhm and Chairman Chang Gon Lee commented It is best to endure to people day for confirmed patient The government needs to prepare for long term battle not short term battle It like an optical illusion but the situation in Daegu and Gyeongbuk has been booming Eom Joong sik professor of infectious medicine at Gil Hospital Gachon University who was member of the Advisory Committee on the Academic Coronavirus Infectious Diseases Countermeasures Committee spoke at talk hosted by lt Hankyore gt on the afternoon of March th On the day when the evaluation of the spread of Corona declined along with the decrease in the number of contributors to Shincheonji in Daegu and Gyeongbuk Professor Um an infectious disease expert and Professor Yoon Goon Kim professor of medical management at Seoul National University College of Medicine and Lee Chang gon health care journalist The chairman of the Social Research Institute and lt Hankyoreh gt Editorial Committee held an emergency meeting The intention was to remove the optical illusion that concealed everything and to predict and prepare for the future scientific development The three experts were at the conference room on the th floor of the Hankyoreh Newspaper for about hours and minutes from pm on this day In the situation we searched for the best alternative Erasing Shincheonji will introduce pandemic rather than decline Yichanggon Director hereinafter the President ll start with two contradictory news talk yet noticeable in connection with this morning Corona In Korea it is said that the spread of wave has been cut and it is proliferation phase worldwide did It is the same as the illusion of Professor Eom Jung sik hereafter Professor Eom In Korea unique cluster infection infection called Sincheonji denomination is rare in the world The reproduction index is often referred to as propagation power According to the internal evaluation of Prof Bo Yul Choi of Hanyang University Medical School Seoul and Gyeonggi communities are Daegu and Gyeongbuk are and Shincheon only but is reported If it it incredible but as thousands of definite people come out of Shincheonji our fashion is in strange shape It looks very bad but it is similar to other countries except for Shincheonji There were several clusters in the community at the level of to people which is little over the French situation at the level of confirmers If you look at the rest of the data except Shincheonji it is level that rises slightly with slight amplitude from the first patient It was the right level when to people were confirmed each day For that reason it is the beginning of the pandemic in Korea not the decline and it seems that there is to chance that it will be amplified gradually when it enters the actual pandemic Professor Kim Professor Kim Special factors such as Shincheonji in Daegu and Gyeongbuk caused massive infections but now that the parts are well controlled it seems that Corona patients are shrinking Korea should be divided into two Shincheonji and the rest Among other parts sporadic group infections are likely to continue at facilities and places where people gather in groups such as call centers nursing homes and disabled facilities There is possibility that the number of patients will increase lot more than now if it is spread out in the nd and rd order because it is not managed Professor Um fandemic will go from August to September and severely from October to November but it is best to endure the average number of additional diagnoses per day during the cluster coming out from to It difficult to get rid of it completely and you have to take lot more resources and sacrifices think that it would be best to keep the medical system well while dragging this long focusing on the critically ill and reducing the number of deaths to minimum society like chicken coop that maximizes efficiency In addition to Shinchonji Lee think Korea has relatively cultural and social background with high possibility of collective infection Not only in Shincheonji but also in places like Seoul Guro Call Center where there are large scale confirmers and there are many multi use facilities Prof Uhm My country doesn seem to have middle Even if it Shincheon the method of mission is really unique and it doesn stop people from being thrilled The density and strength of the contact is too strong Is it okay elsewhere In order to maximize efficiency the call center sits closely in private booth partition space to handle work and the hospital puts as many people as possible into hospital room In order to maximize efficiency Korean society is culture in which everything is dense and dense in line with illegality Infectious disease is helpless Even when raising chickens the chicken coop is dense enough but when the avian influenza turns the chickens die The individual needs to be bit loose but Korea is society where the distance is not recognized Prof Eom Lee said that it is likely to go from October to November but experts are also considering measures to deal with infectious diseases in the long term breakdown Of course Professor Um government must be willing to end this phase quickly But in order to minimize the damage and finish it faster the government needs to be little cooler Experts believe that there is lot of potential to go on and are discussing how to respond in the future Without system the offensive cannot solve the situation ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

fioeq46,It a joke Germany donated only few million so far Vaccine will costs billions How does Germany deal with the corona virus At the World Health Organization Foreign Minister Maas reserves the right to take tougher measures and finds out how expensive vaccine will be Christoph Schult reports from Geneva February pm At the Palais des Nations the headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva visitors are greeted with leaflets They explain the hygiene measures to be taken in the face of possible corona pandemic wash your hands regularly sneeze and cough in the crook of your arm avoid contact with sick people wear respirator in case of fever Heiko Maas actually came to Geneva to promote his Alliance of Multilateralists at the UN But in view of the Corona crisis the Foreign Minister makes detour to the World Health Organization in the morning In brilliant sunshine and spring like temperatures he walks over to WHO headquarters Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomes his guest in front of the WHO building It is sign of gratitude after all Maas brings the promise of three million euros in additional emergency aid In English the Ethiopian thanks for the great support from Germany and adds in German Thank you very much WHO experts consider risk of global crisis high Tedros takes the minister down to the WHO crisis room Here the scale of the outbreak of Covid as the disease is officially called becomes clear Graphs on screens show how dramatic the situation is huge map of the world shows how rapidly the virus has spread in recent weeks Red circles of different sizes show how many infections the individual countries have registered so far China more than cases South Korea between and cases Germany is therefore in the same category as Italy and France to cases After the recent deaths in Italy Maas wants to know behind closed doors what scenario the WHO people consider likely According to this the experts hardly believe in an eradication of the virus Either local endemics would remain or the outbreaks would combine to form worldwide pandemic according to the forecast few weeks ago this was considered rather unlikely but now the risk of global crisis is considered high The Geneva health experts message is that we must prepare for this Germany has so far reacted in an exemplary manner praise Maas hosts They cite the convertible roof manufacturer in Stockdorf as an example By intervening early the Bavarian company had succeeded in locating and isolating the patient zero and his contact persons thus preventing the spread of the virus However the disease has not yet been sufficiently researched The fact that some people are apparently infected but show no or hardly any symptoms is proving to be insidious This means that in Italy the virus has probably been passed on by people who do not know that they are carrying it in their bodies This makes containment difficult the search for the patient zero almost impossible It is unclear from when exactly and for how long an infected person is contagious the current situation report of the Federal Foreign Office also states According to the WHO experts the quality of the health system is crucial for combating the disease About per cent of the diseases are serious In countries with good health care it is possible to keep mortality below one per cent but in developing countries the risk increases The WHO is therefore currently very concerned about the situation in Iran However the situation in Japan South Korea and Italy shows that other countries are not immune to crisis We are monitoring developments in real time so to speak Heiko Meuse We re finding that the virus is spreading further says Maas However we must not dramatise the situation think it will be particularly difficult if the virus spreads to regions that are not developed in the way it has Developing producing distributing vaccines that costs billions of euros However the Foreign Minister hints that the deaths in Italy could also worsen the situation in Germany However the Federal Government does not consider an automatic quarantine for all travellers to China to be necessary at least not yet As in many other countries not all people coming from China will have to be quarantined said Maas However we are monitoring developments in real time so to speak and can react to changed

flat1v7,haha yep it includes only empty platitudes and not single thing explaining how to assist working class families what if for example it had included something like say this gt Federal Assistance to Hard Hit Families gt Health Crisis Unemployment Initiative to Help all Workers Facing Loss for Work Due to the COVID Crisis The reduction in demand for services such as hospitality necessary closing of workplaces and disruptions in supply chains will impact workers in all types of work arrangements Just as the Obama Biden Administration expanded regular unemployment insurance during the Great Recession Joe Biden will again call for expanded Emergency Unemployment Compensation that will not only support workers facing extended spells of unemployment but expand benefits and eligibility to address the nature of the job loss that will be impacted for the duration of the crisis The Biden Plan calls for immediate expanded federal relief for impacted workers that includes gt Ensuring Unemployment Benefits UI Are Available to Those Who Lose Jobs but Would Be Denied Benefits Due to Rules that Should Not Apply in Major Health Crisis and Economic Downturn The Biden Plan calls for expanded and broadened unemployment benefits that ensure our unemployment benefit policies are responsive to the depth and nature of this health and economic crisis That means more support for state offices that will face far higher demand It means waiving or relaxing work history waiting and work search requirements that could prevent millions who might lose work due to no fault of their own from being left out in the cold Current UI rules rightly require recipients to be actively looking for work The nature of the COVID crisis means however that many who lose their jobs will be prevented from looking for work due to public health rules related to containing community spread The Biden Plan will ensure that workers who lose jobs but cannot meet search requirements due to this public health crisis are not denied benefits This initiative can be combined with efforts to expand and reform our existing Disaster Unemployment Assistance program gt Employment Relief for Reduced Hours or Work Sharing Arrangements In addition to assistance for those who lose jobs the Biden Plan will design unemployment insurance benefits to encourage expanded work sharing arrangements for workers at businesses that are forced to cut back payroll due to lower economic demand diminished travel or cancelled orders The Biden Plan will ensure that partial unemployment benefits are available to workers facing significant reduction in hours so as to encourage employers to choose work sharing over layoffs where possible Such policies will build on those implemented by the Obama Biden Administration during the Great Recession The Biden Plan will require that this is implemented in way that is consistent with existing collective bargaining agreements and that any employer with employees represented by union create these arrangements in cooperation with the unions gt Provide Employment Relief for Domestic Workers Caregivers Gig Workers or Independent Contractors who face Reduced Pay and Hours Too often our unemployment relief only helps those who are in more formal employer employee relations It leaves out too many of the hardest working most hard pressed Americans who drive cars clean homes and care for our younger and older loved ones The Biden Plan will offer economic relief to all workers who can show hours have been cut back due to COVID or to resulting economic impacts gt Expand Food Relief for Hard Pressed Families and Children The Biden Plan calls for health crisis food initiative that addresses both the depth of potential economic hardship for families and the nature of this health crisis Economic hardship caused by the crisis will stretch family budgets in ways that could reduce needed nutrition Many students rely on free or discounted meals at schools which may have to close The Biden Plan health crisis food initiative will create federal state partnership fully funded by the federal government that will expand SNAP relief for the duration of the crisis as well as broaden the type of food relief responses available to states from supporting food banks across the nation to increased home delivery of food to broad effort to replace lost school meals It will adjust current policies that will harshly cut off or deny food benefits to workers unable to find work in this crisis It will allow schools to submit waiver applications before they are impacted by the crisis making it easier for them to get permission to provide food even when school is closed gt Increase Federal Medical Assistance Percentage FMAP for the state administered Medicaid program The Biden Plan calls for an increase in the share the federal government pays of Medicaid the so called FMAP This is one of the fastest most effective means to concurrently address the health and revenue burdens states face when confronting an economic crisis The Biden Plan will increase the FMAP by at least percent for all states during the crisis with upward adjustments for states that are facing particularly high unemployment rates It will also provide additional financial incentives for states that have not yet expanded their Medicaid program and will provide necessary additional support to Puerto Rico and other territories to ensure the health care needs of these populations are not neglected gt Establish Temporary Small and Medium Sized Business Loan Facility Many businesses that would otherwise thrive during normal economic times will face severe shortfall in cash flow potentially jeopardizing their ability to make payrolls pay creditors and keep their doors open Working with the Small Business Association and Treasury Department the Biden Plan proposes to establish temporary small business loan program designed to address unanticipated shortfalls in revenue by offering interest free loans to small and medium sized businesses around the country through the duration of the crisis Biden plan includes both increased funding capacity for the Small Business Administration in addition to new program modeled after the Obama Biden State Small Business Credit Initiative that provides funds to allow states to increase lending to small businesses The Biden Plan also calls on the S Treasury Department to coordinate with the Federal Reserve to monitor and consider policies to address severe credit and liquidity challenges related to the fall out of COVID and thus prevent small businesses and those in impacted industries from severe cutbacks shutdowns and layoffs gt Support for Child Care and Remote Student Learning Potential school closings will create significant cost issues for parents seeking childcare and for schools and educators seeking to continue teaching remotely including online The Biden Plan will expand assistance to federal child care centers and assistance to schools particularly Title schools for those facing schools facing extra costs including efforts to continue remote education or remote activities normally done after school gt Relief or Forbearance of Federal Student Loans and Federally Backed Mortgages Congress must immediately use new legislation or existing authority to provide assistance of forbearance to students and homeowners to provide financial relief until the worst of the economic fall out of the crisis is over As proposed below there must also be federal partnership with states and cities to provide rental relief during the crisis so no one faces evictions due to impacts of the COVID crisis gt Protecting union health funds Union members have fought hard for their health insurance Biden will commit to ensuring their Taft Hartley health funds have the financial resources they need to continue despite the crisis it sure is embarrassing that could come up with all of that off the top of my head and Biden couldn think of anything even close to put on his website https joebiden com covid what an absolute amateur shake my damn smdh my damn

fl6weex,What is society The most notor ious answer we ve been given in the last forty years was tri umphant negation uttered by Margaret Thatcher in an interview with Woman Own magazine in There is no such thing The left has ensured that Thatcher words have not been forgotten the right has oc casionally sought to remind people of her next sent ence There are individual men and women and there are families But does anything connect those individual men and women with those families The term social is the weasel word par excellence Thatcher intellectual inspir ation Friedrich Hayek wrote in Nobody knows what it actually means Hayek was in no doubt that patterns emerged in the behaviour of populations and might eventually lead to form of large scale self organisation The best way of ensuring this happened was to build communications infrastructure that would make it possible for millions of people to share information in real time In Hayek view that infrastructure was the price system of free market As the Covid crisis was beginning to take hold in the US the New York Times carried story about an online retailer in Tennessee called Matt Colvin who had stockpiled bottles of hand sanitiser in order to exploit surging demand only to have his account suspended by Amazon Colvin actions prompted widespread disgust But wasn he just respond ing to price signals Or does the weasel word mean something after all Perhaps the boldest conceptual vision of society belongs to mile Durkheim In Suicide Study in Sociology he argu ed that society was social fact which couldn be reduced to matters of psych ology or economics Individuals were constrained and shaped by trends and norms that were manifest only at macro level By tracking variations in the suicide rate over time and across nations Durkheim de monstrated that its level didn only have to do with economic welfare or individual choice At each moment of its history each society has definite aptitude for suicide The task of sociology Durkheim believ ed would be to study this kind of social fact and its principal evidence would be statistics Sociology as he conceived it was joining political project that was already well underway nowhere more so than in France to analyse the nation in terms of measurable quantities births deaths and causes of death Suicide was useful case study for the sociologist partly because it appeared on the face of it to be such solitary phenomenon but also because there was already plenty of international data on the topic Not only could statistics reveal the various aggregates that make up society but more important they could identify the invisible norms binding us all together the averages We are all Durkheimians now Every day the headlines are dominated by announcements of the latest aggregates and averages from nations around the world Statistics swirl about on social media as people form speculations on the basis of their own mental arithmetic what per cent of this or per cent of that and who to say the per cent isn actually per cent and why isn the South Korean average the same as the Italian one But at their root stat istics are combination of state led data collection and probabilistic modelling Demographic averages offer little secu rity to the individual unless they are accom pan ied by widespread solidarity and the sharing of risk None of this could be further from the idea of society that propelled Boris Johnson to power and which is all but useless to him now Brexit was fuelled by desire for the society of collectively imagined past for nation While Remainers spoke of GDP and other macroeconomic indicators Leavers offered the cultural sym bols of community that had supposed ly been dissolved by multiculturalism and globalis ation and by their over educated spokespeople Yes it was about stronger borders but just as important was the right to be proud of flags Britain and England Nations promise plenty of solidarity just not for everyone Brexit didn need committed Brexiteer at the helm it just need ed someone who was unapologetic about the collateral damage it would cause columnist with dim regard for facts was the perfect person to execute project whose chief aspect was imaginary Watching Johnson at recent press conferences flanked by the government chief medical officer Chris Whitty and its chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance you saw man struggling with his every instinct For decades mischievous smirk joke here hair ruffle there have been enough to make newspaper editors interviewers Have Got News

can quite shake the habit of lifetime On conference call with the CEOs of sixty manufacturing businesses urging collective effort to produce more ventilators for the NHS Johnson reportedly referred to the plan as Operation Last Gasp The imagined community of Britain or England is on hold for the foreseeable future While Britain shifts hesitantly onto war footing the cultural and economic divides that split the nation in two in the summer of have been suspended save for the self separation of privileged few who are able to escape to remote island or hunker down in the country pile for few months The generational divide is the one that still counts above all but it appears in very different light now compared with just few weeks ago What is society then to the likes of Whitty and Vallance the men whom Johnson is said to be obeying so loyally Ult imately it is network made up of billions of interconnected nodes You can try to impose nation on this network as Donald Trump has done with his travel bans and his maniacal effort to buy vaccine for ex clusive use within the United States but networks are governed by mathematical not sovereign laws Society conceived as network

fkqrefi,In the darkness of the early hours Monday about dozen immigration agents gathered outside Starbucks in Bell Gardens For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who make daily arrests it was supposed to be business as usual But that morning they greeted one another with elbows instead of handshakes the Starbucks where they rendezvoused was only grab and go and they passed freeway signs that read Wash your hands stay healthy avoid COVID The ICE agents were about to spend the day trying to arrest targets on most unusual of days the day after the California governor and A mayor ordered people to ramp up their efforts of social distancing over the coronavirus The agents had respirator masks in their vehicles just in case ADVERTISEMENT With safety measures taken across the state immigrant advocates have criticized ICE for its continued enforcement operations More than organizations signed letter this week calling on the Department of Homeland Security to suspend such actions ICE said it would take precautions given the new reality But the arrests would go on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs amp Border Protection agents advance on residence during early morning apprehensions in Bell Gardens as more resources are deployed in sanctuary cities Al Seib Los Angeles Times We re out here trying to protect the public by getting these criminal aliens off the street and out of our communities said David Marin the director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE in A Asking us to stop doing that basically gives those criminals another opportunity to maybe commit more crimes to create more victims In the parking lot the group of agents stood in loose circle not quite six feet apart as they reviewed the target list That morning they were searching for four people including two registered sex offenders Among the gathered officers were two S Customs and Border Protection officers identifiable only by patch on their vest with their agency name They were among nine total CBP agents and officers deployed to the A area in the last few weeks to assist ICE in making arrests ADVERTISEMENT They rattled off the height weight and daily routines of the people they sought to arrest Nearly all the targets lived within one mile radius With many schools closed due to coronavirus and some people staying home from work it was unclear how arrests would go that morning We couldn factor this in right This COVID and the precautions that everybody taking Marin said We just have to continue to go with the same game plan that we ve been doing All of the officers had been issued the protective masks over the past few weeks In his car Marin kept packets of hand sanitizer wipes which he used that morning to wipe down his steering wheel his keys and his hands after pumping gas Pedro Castillo Bravo sits in Removal Operations Processing Center in downtown Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents made early morning arrest Al Seib Los Angeles Times Around m the officers waited outside of Pedro Castillo Bravo home He was convicted in for DUI causing bodily injury and hit and run The officers knew the year old would soon be heading out to work collecting metal In less than an hour they spotted movement in the driveway can tell if it the target or not but they got into the target vehicle an officer voice crackled over the radio After Castillo prepared to leave an officer knocked on his car door He asked if Castillo was sick or taking medication to which he said no He asked him if he been arrested before and Castillo admitted he had The officer who wore pair of black gloves handcuffed Castillo and placed him in the back of white Dodge Challenger Since the conviction Castillo said he had not driven again drunk That morning after work he planned to visit the grocery store worried about the lack of food at home and the stores emptying amid panic buying m the head of the house Castillo said growing teary eyed If they have me here locked up what about rent and food ADVERTISEMENT Shortly after m the officers were at the next home on Lanto Street where they looked for man who had been convicted of sexual battery and sentenced to three years summary probation When ICE pulled him over he told them he had green card His crime Marin said made him removable Officers placed the man in the backseat beside Castillo As few officers took the men to be processed the rest went to door knock in nearby mobile home park They were searching for man convicted of receiving stolen property and conspiracy to commit crime Instead they encountered his wife and two children both home from school that day because of closures We re the only ones here the man wife told the officer allowing him to come inside and look around After striking out the agents circled back to Starbucks for coffee and bathroom break Inside staff were not allowing customers to put their own cream or sugar to help stop the spread of coronavirus And the bathroom they been waiting for was closed to the public badge or no David Marin is director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Los Angeles Field Office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE Al Seib Los Angeles Times As the officers stood outside man approached them to ask if it was true that the sheriff got the coronavirus The officers said no Throughout the day they spotted people wearing masks and others with arms full of toilet paper and paper towels Coronavirus has had effects across the agency In the building where Marin works downtown officials have talked about limiting contact with the public On Tuesdays and Thursdays there are people who cram into waiting room and line up outside against the wall for check ins with ICE some of them arriving every days We might have to adjust that and make it or days maybe to limit their contact Marin said We ll work on that on case by case basis ADVERTISEMENT Homeland Security Investigations branch within Immigration and Customs Enforcement postponed its citizens academy Advanced classes at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers have been canceled Marin meeting with faith based leaders was canceled Over the weekend Marin sat down with senior leadership to determine which jobs might allow staff to telework Aside from mission support specialists that seemed out of the question Our job is not job that you can telework from Marin said Processing people or doing check ins with people that can be done via telework Later that morning officers waited outside the last house on their list that day They usually saw their target leave his home between and But that morning they waited an hour and half and never saw him This guy late Marin said speculating that he changed his pattern because of coronavirus But the biggest change became clear as Marin drove downtown on the north Where is the traffic he asked,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
flbvnce,So far The count rate for all the other epidemics is in year increments It been like months since the Covid outbreak started Updates this week are starting to reflect improvement now so yay used to do these charts for living have very weird career path The current data set is very small and the numbers are going to look scariest right now because we re not sure the number of infected TOTAL only confirmed cases N data follows similar curve if you look at the progression of data while we were tracking it We weren sure if that would be the case or if the percent trend would continue Now it looks more like flu epidemic level to percent worst case and we may actually come out way better because the other factors that made that so deadly are in our favor with the current situation Corona virus as in the common cold is basically the most infectious thing on Earth but since deadly variety is so rare we re not very prepared for it on an immunity basis Corona and flu viruses mutate so rapidly that any flu vaccine is usually playing catch up Otherwise you need flu vaccine like tetanus vaccines not every year The same reason you can get flu or colds every year and chicken pox once We re more prepared as society than as individuals We have no regular corona vaccine only SARS and MERS and those were both developed with technology we ve barely scratched yet We learned lot from SARS and MERS so we have jumpstart That why testing could be invented so quickly and the shortage is producing tests not race to create the test itself like with SARS About percent of initial patients are recovered so far as we know which is great news If we manage to deflect collapse and reduce infections that will rapidly drop the death rate and possibly the death numbers into something that looks good compared to other outbreaks It a very doable thing Epidemiologists are pointing out that the level of technology we have to fight this is unprecedented will be very surprised if we don have vaccine within the month projected window The infection rate has been hard to pin down because we re seeing larger number of asymptomatic carriers than is typical The specific problems data is running into are going to take long time to sort out How many are actually infected currently or have been or will be No idea as testing is too new This will actually remain open as highly doubt all countries will be able to antibody test all citizens How many people really were treated or died in China Iran Russia and other countries not known for being at all honest on news matters Could be exactly as reported could be more could be less The pandemic is progressing everywhere and has yet to peak in most of the world China is probably over the hump Italy in the middle American getting started Mexico barely beginning African countries who the hell knows if we can even collect data We have no credible data on reinfection all speculation so far as not enough time has passed Is it possible probable or improbable Will see resurgence like in winter after summer was safer Will summer even be safer Tropical countries being warmer has had zero effect on the virus Humidity seems to perhaps make some difference but is not yet proven Just like N or AIDS it will be better in some countries than others Population and wealth policy and supply line will vary wildly For instance Italy has very high median age people in war torn areas will have less access to care people in Wyoming live so far apart social distance is default mode people in California locked ourselves in while people in Florida went to the beach There was an earthquake in Croatia so an emergency on top of an emergency is unpredictable Will people accidentally spread this once we go back to normal because it ll show up somewhere that thought it skipped them Could there be asymptomatic carriers long term Will the vaccine or cure be given to everyone Total crapshoot What are the long term effects So far we know it causes lung scarring How many will be disabled Will it be comparable to Polio Not enough time yet Unimportant except to epidemiologists and historians How many deaths to flu or pneumonia in November December January were actually Covid We re unlikely to ever know the answer to this ,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

fkpcxrn,OK see where you re coming from But fundamentally disagree and can explain where Bernie is coming from Not saying you re outright wrong just saying think the calculus works out in favor of the progressive side of things The response to COVID is made significantly harder because of structural issues with the way medicine is delivered in the United States The lack of excess capacity is directly tied to the profit motive of health care providers Many countries that do not allow hospitals to be money making endeavors for large multi hospital firms like Ascension have many many more beds per person and as such were significantly more prepared to handle the crises than America is Biden pointed to Italy but Italy is country where you have to take ANY social program in context because they have hard time collecting taxes enforcing laws more generally South Korea is perfect example and has the single best response to COVID of any nation in the world and is one of the most socialized systems When you say focus on the now the issue is that if we make it through this without fundamentally fixing things then the next time this happens as it will with increasing frequency in an ever more populous world with climate that heating up we will just explode every time this happens Additionally the use of the military is feel good solution to the current problem The military does not have the anti virals face masks researchers doctors etc to solve the problem Furthermore Sanders did suggest some short term plans mostly economic but he correctly pointed out that the current system is completely unsustainable Biden has indicated he has no intention of making any sort of change to the system that would help the next time this happens On climate change we face the same issue we just haven faced the reckoning yet Nothing Biden suggests solves the problem We need far greater change than rejoining the Paris Accords or the same thing that is currently happening with COVID will happen with climate Your choices are vote for man who will get nothing past the Republicans but nothing he suggests will solve any of the problems or vote for man who will get nothing past the Republicans but at least has identified that the entire country will simply explode if we ever have two major events in one year In fact it not entirely clear that COVID wont put the US into another lost decade like the financial crash did in The policies either solve the problem or they don Biden policies simply do not solve the problems They are not practical because neither can he get the votes as Obama proved nor do they fix anything Look don like Sanders on personal level As jew myself he reminds me too much of shouty great uncle bit of caricature But it should be apparent from the situation around COVID that anything like the current healthcare system in the United States is so far from workable that we need to throw it out and start over and if it not obvious now it will be in weeks when we ve had couple of doubling cycles of infected rates and people in rural areas who have no hospitals start dropping like flies ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
ffw3vzb,One of the primary reasons that masks and respirators when they are capable of doing so fail to protect is because of our propensity to touch our facial mucous membranes The average contact rate per hour is https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed People also have high propensity to adjust their masks and splash eye protection frequently This compromises the isolation these devices provide No scientist or infectious disease worker or researcher working with level or pathogen would even consider using anything less than full face respirator and preferably Powered Air Purifying Respirator PARP with an filter So it is not unreasonable for people to attempt to use something that prevents them from contaminating their faces There are however serious problems with using water bottles as shown in the picture above First the people using these bottles appear not to be wearing masks Second if the top of the bottle is open to the air it will create chimney effect whereby the heat from the head and exhaled breath will rise escape the top and thereby create continuous flow of environmental air streaming over the head and face nCoV is close relative to the SARS coronavirus and it is well established that SARS is primarily transmitted by bio aerosol droplets and or direct personal contacts https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed The SARS and MERS coronaviruses remain viable on environmental surfaces for days to week under indoor ambient conditions and viability period in excess of month at deg Thus it would be incautious if not irresponsible to presume anything other than that there is high probability of nCoV being transmitted by bioaerosols Bioaerosols smaller than microns are routinely present in exhaled air and are principal means by which influenza and measles are transmitted Bioaerosols microns and below can follow the inhaled air stream to the terminal airways including the alveoli Thus barrier protection is essential in addition to splash protection from the microns or larger particles generated by coughing and sneezing Both surgical and masks only reduce the concentration of influenza viral particles on average by fold For an etiologic agent as infectious as influenza or measles this provides an unacceptably low level of protection https royalsocietypublishing org doi rsif focus https royalsocietypublishing org doi rsif focus In fact there are no robust studies demonstrating the superiority of surgical masks over masks in providing protection against respiratory infection including with influenza https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC Protection from infection with nCoV during protracted epidemic is likely to require the same kind of precautions and technique needed to protect mouse colonies against inadvertent infection with influenza where the mortality rate is or greater These precautions take into account that the virus can be transmitted on clothing and footwear Cover gowns respirators and disinfectant mats are the mainstays of prevention coupled with rigorous technique to avoid breaching these barriers have watched videos from Wutan where people use masks gloves and goggles to go out shopping wherein they walk across grocery store floors that are clearly unkempt rubbish visible and filled with other shoppers only to return home unaware that they may have carried the virus into their home on their feet They also do not remove their protective clothing and place it into clean plastic bagoutside the entryway for later laundering nor do they discard their face mask and sanitize their goggles by washing in detergent water or with biocidal wipes containing the appropriate concentration of isopropyl alcohol quats https en wikipedia org wiki Quaternary ammonium cation or dilute bleach Quats are an excellent choice for ad hoc germicidal mats g towel wetted with disinfectant outside the entryway to the home because they are effective against the coronaviruses and unlike bleach are not damaging to clothing and furnishings They also very low toxicity to humans and pets Quats are commonly used in disinfectant wipes sold for household use This is the level of protection that is required to achieve definitive barrier to the transmission of etiologic agents such SARS the influenzas and measles viruses in the laboratory While masks and unvented goggles are likely to reduce the transmission rate they are unlikely to provide the desired degree of protection in prolonged pandemic Isolation is the best protection so minimizing the number of trips outside the home and wiping down all items to be brought into the home with quats or alcohol based disinfectants will likely provide the highest degree of protection when used in conjunction with disinfectant mats good technique in donning and doffing protective clothing and the use of full face respirators proving filtration ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
fkw7qsr,Yeah honestly the fact that such glorious vessel is not only basically abandoned to rot but that her doing so is likely causing an unimaginable amount of damage to the river which m not saying was in great shape otherwise hell that water has few centuries of bad handling under its belt at this point but every little bit counts is kind of goddamned travesty At the very least it a shame and we should feel ashamed It a shame that we have the funds to preserve battleship one which isn even unique right across the river but we can do the same for perhaps the last great fast transatlantic passenger liner that was or will ever be built There won be anymore when the United States is gone and nobody should be able to fool themselves into thinking that it not going because it sure as hell is and it isn like there are museum ships of lots of other ships like her Military museum ships on the other hand are located in every state bordering water or at least damned near all of them All three of the Iowa class battleships besides New Jersey are museum ships but there are many other battleships besides these not to mention aircraft carriers cruisers destroyers subs etc ve toured bunch of them and even spent the night on couple it a nice way to spend day not as nice way to spend night Obviously this is coronavirus thread so m going to go ahead and acknowledge how we have people who are going to be forced to choose between quarantining themselves or going to their job and infecting others and obviously of course putting themselves at risk and being miserable in the process which isn a choice because if they took time off they lose that job and then they wouldn be able to eat or maintain their housing much less pay for medical care We obviously have fucked up system and we have plenty of problems to solve before we get around to preserving old ships as museums but it really isn an either or proposition We ve been making museum ships for long time doing so is certainly more expensive at least upfront because military ships have you know weapons on them Besides the amount of resources it would take to preserve and convert the SS S is frankly minuscule in the scope of our national budget Seriously ve been in the military and worked job that gave me look at supply costs They re ludicrous but then again military is expensive and it should be billion in other words many times the cost to purchase the ship is not very much for country with our means The issue as is almost always the case is what we choose to spend our money on and how we collect it We could raise taxes or sell bonds or we could cut spending in any number of areas The military could do without couple of manned fighter aircraft they re pretty much useless in the st century anyway especially considering that we don have any adversaries that have capable fighter fleet and we currently fly the best fighters in the world already In the end our choice to neglect this liner while so many military ships which are largely unremarkable and not at all unique are preserved is perhaps unintentionally apropos illustration of how our society values different things and what shame it is that we choose to pay what we do for the things we choose to buy when we have the option to pay for other things but we instead allow them to just decay and drift away Alright ve certainly gotten bit too wispy amp introspective and rambled perhaps bit too much but really do love ships and having grown up visiting them and then went to war on one then moved to an apartment few blocks away from the SS S seeing it always made me sad and believe that great ship like it should never conjure that emotion in people ,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

life be they joys or sorrows disaster or good fortune fairness as well as to profit loves and hates It is but human to be conflicted by wants and needs to be prone to the agonies of separation and

Sino American relationship has been unfolding Added to all of that is an overall economic decline that eludes simple resolution as well as the real time international isolation that China has been experiencing due to its increasingly aggressive foreign posture All of these things are symptomatic of policy failure yet further proof that Strong Man Politics phenomenon that cuts against the very nature of modern political life produces results that are at glaring variance with the avowed aim of their author that is Xi Jinping Amid this suffocating situation there is widespread anxiety that we are caught in stalemate People are bedeviled and straining to think of ways to break through the logjam and inaugurate new possibilities There has of course been fervent hope among many that certain internal dynamics may possibly result in situation that can clear the way perhaps something welling up from below that may positively influence those above Just as such pipe dream seemed to capture people imaginations developments in Hong Kong and Taiwan showed how the periphery can suddenly throw the centre off kilter Events in those places have been so dramatic in fact that they may even offer ray of hope For it is perhaps only perhaps that with such path forward one in which the periphery gradually influences the centre and makes imaginable some kind of peaceful transition that particular Chinese Way out of our present political conundrum may be found Perhaps too the besieged city of Wuhan beset as it is by crisis may also prove to be Jerusalem place of hope and peace an old city proffering new hope To put it another way breakthrough originating from the periphery may augur once more as it did in the the the and again in the a moment that favors push towards meaningful constitutional and legal rule in China We may well be at just such juncture even as the faint light of new dawn is promised on the horizon we nonetheless remain in the gloaming we are no longer lost in the pitch dark of night yet still the roseate promise of new day eludes us Still that bastion of power holds itself together tightly crumbling edifice reluctant as ever to acquiesce to the popular will But look there the draw bridge that leads way out that is the promise offered by events in Hong Kong and Taiwan has been lowered just so far Is this not time spoken of by prophets even though many will fail and fall before the dawn light ushers in new day present these Nine Points for the consideration of my fellow countrymen and women It is all too obvious and mere common sense But let me reiterate my key point when nation has yet to enter normal state of rule when its people and their civilization are yet to transition into truly modern era we must continue forward with fortitude and hope we must strive to bring about constitutional democracy and realize true People Republic We have now been part of this long breaking wave of modernity for over one and half centuries since the fledgling reform movement of the in the Qing dynasty It is herein that we play role That right we We the People for as have previously said how can we let ourselves survive no better than swine fawn upon the power holders like curs and live in vile filth like maggots As write these words reflect on my own situation which also dramatically changed in when the author published his famous anti Xi Jeremiad For having raised my voice then was punished for speech crimes Thereafter was suspended from my job as university lecturer and cashiered as professor reduced to minor academic rank was placed under investigation by my employer Tsinghua University my freedoms have been curtailed ever since Writing as do herein can now all too easily predict that will be subjected to new punishments indeed this may well even be the last piece write But that is not for me to say Confronted by this Great Virus as all of us are right now feel as though vast chasm has opened up before us all and feel compelled to speak out yet again There is no refuge from this viral reality and cannot remain silent To act in any other way would be to betray my nature In Western philosophy they call it righteous indignation it is kind of fury that results from repeated abrasion Our own thinkers speak of it as humanity combined with sense of justice It is what Mencius called the true way of the human heart and thus agitated a bookish scholar who dares to think of himself as an intellectual am prepared to pay for it with my life Here the author quotes the Confucian text Mencius Benevolence is the heart of man and rightness his road Sad it is indeed when man gives up the right road instead of following it and allows his heart to stray without enough sense to go after it Translated by C Lau Mencius Book VI Part In the end it is about Freedom that Transcendent Quality well spring and fulcrum of conscious action that secular value proven to be the most divine aspiration of humankind that innate sensibility that truly makes us human that ineffable suchness that we Chinese share with all others The spirit of the world that spirit incarnate on earth makes possible glorious unfolding of Freedom itself This is why friends my countless compatriots though sea of flames confronts us can we let ourselves be held back by fear Oh Vast Land beneath our feet it is You that now address You inspire the most profound feelings yet you can be cruel in your dispensation Despite the bounty of your promise all too often you assail us with ceaseless troubles Bit by bit you gnaw away at our patience inch by

eyes fill with tears and my heart gasps And so it is that say unto You in the words of the poet Dylan Thomas will not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave at close of day Rage rage against the dying of the light And that is why people like me feeble scholars though we are are useless for we can do nothing more than lament take up our pens avail ourselves of what we write to

fjn5k5u,Text from the China post Local companies and officials are fraudulently boosting electricity consumption and other metrics in order to meet tough new back to work targets as the spread of Covid in China wanes Caixin investigation has found As new coronavirus cases in China slowed in recent weeks local governments in less affected regions pushed companies and factories to return to work typically by assigning concrete targets to district officials Company insiders and local civil servants told Caixin that under pressure to fulfill quotas they could not otherwise meet they deftly cooked the books Leaving lights and air conditioners on all day long in empty offices turning on manufacturing equipment faking staff rosters and even coaching factory workers to lie to inspectors are just some of the ways they helped manufacture flashy statistics on the resumption of business for local governments to report up the chain Electricity consumption data has regularly been used as proxy for the business resumption rate when reporting to Beijing and to the public The East China province of Zhejiang has been lauded as prime example of the nation industrial recovery from the coronavirus outbreak by China top economic planner which reported on Feb that its work resumption rate was more than Nevertheless civil servant in one district of the provincial capital Hangzhou told Caixin that from Saturday plants were instructed to leave their industrial equipment idling for the whole day while offices were told to keep computers and air conditioners running when Beijing began checking the resumption rate by examining power consumption figures Caixin has chosen not to name the district to protect the identity of the civil servant who could face repercussions for revealing the information publicly But reached by phone one company insider in the district said they saw such directives in multiple corporate WeChat groups Another said they received the order too but their operations had already resumed two weeks prior and its production lines were in normal operation by Feb Another executive said they were not informed of the electricity use target and said they were running at about one fifth of normal capacity with only small proportion of machines in use Hangzhou target was for corporate electricity consumption that day to hit of what it was on Jan and that it should return to at least of that by March The real resumption rate in one industrial park in Hangzhou over the weekend was the civil servant estimated far below the target The district official pointed out China is further subsidizing electricity costs as way to incentivize businesses to resume and said many companies would rather waste small amount of money on power than irritate local officials Insiders told Caixin that in some cases rather than giving companies direct targets local governments assigned quotas to local district officials who were then directly responsible for meeting them Those officials would regularly visit the companies prodding them to resume production in the guise of expressing care and support That pressure is likely what drove them to switch on their machines Zhejiang Provincial Government Deputy Secretary General Chen Guangsheng boasted to press on Feb that segment of manufacturing plants in Zhejiang reported work resumption rate of and service enterprises More than of the coastal province companies with annual export value above million had resumed business the provincial leader said company in Wenzhou major commercial center in the same province confirmed it had received designated power consumption target equal to half of the level before the outbreak and had been running its air conditioners all day long to meet the goal Zhejiang is not the only place where the reality on the ground is said to deviate from government figures In the small industrial city of Botou some kilometers miles south of Beijing Caixin found factories reported by the local government to have reopened their doors had not in fact resumed production The head of one told Caixin that despite reports up the chain the local government unwillingness to risk an outbreak meant it had not actually restarted The local government still forbids factories to actually resume work the executive said We have returned to the offices but production has not resumed at all He further said the Botou government asked him to falsely report the number of employees who had returned to work and even went so far as to directly coach workers about how to lie if they received calls from inspectors Prolonged suspension of production had led to the loss of technicians and business orders he added because some of the company peers in other parts of China had resumed manufacturing ahead of them Replying to Caixin request for comment on Monday the Botou government said at least enterprises in the Botou area had resumed business but some companies might have said they did not because while they were registered as having resumed they may not have been prepared to immediately commence production They said companies were permitted to resume normal business after reporting to the local government but could only begin operation after officials confirmed virus control measures were in place source in smaller enterprise in Botou told Caixin companies have been allowed to resume production after meeting certain virus containment requirements but face the further logistical issues as many rural roads remain blocked Without way to get raw materials in and send products out there not much point in businesses returning to production Open data from Baidu Maps shows overall traffic flow inside the Botou city over the weekend was still less than half of the average last year after two weeks of slow recovery starting from Feb ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fgh0hv6,Article GUANGZHOU China One person was turned away by hotel after hotel after he showed his ID card Another was expelled by fearful local villagers third found his most sensitive personal information leaked online after registering with the authorities These outcasts are from Wuhan the capital of Hubei Province where rapidly spreading viral outbreak has killed more than people in China and sent fear rippling around the world They are pariahs in China among the millions unable to go home and feared as potential carriers of the mysterious coronavirus All across the country despite China vast surveillance network with its facial recognition systems and high end cameras that is increasingly used to track its billion people the government has turned to familiar authoritarian techniques like setting up dragnets and asking neighbors to inform on one another as it tries to contain the outbreak It took the authorities about five days to contact Harmo Tang college student studying in Wuhan after he returned to his hometown Linhai in eastern Zhejiang Province Mr Tang said he had already been under self imposed isolation when local officials asked for his personal information including name address phone number identity card number and the date he returned from Wuhan Within days the information began to spread online along with list of others who returned to Linhai from Wuhan Local officials offered no explanation but returned few days later to fasten police tape to his door and hang sign that warned neighbors that Wuhan returnee lived there The sign included an informant hotline to call if anyone saw him or his family leave the apartment Mr Tang said he received about four calls day from different local government departments In reality there not much empathy he said It not caring tone they re using It a warning tone don feel very comfortable about it Of course China has major incentive to track down potential carriers of the disease The coronavirus outbreak has put parts of the country under lockdown brought the world second largest economy to virtual standstill and erected walls between China and the rest of the world Still even some government officials called for understanding as concerns about prejudice spread Experts warned such marginalization of an already vulnerable group could prove counterproductive further damaging public trust and sending those who should be screened and monitored deeper underground We are paying attention to this issue Ma Guoqiang the Chinese Communist Party secretary of Wuhan said at news conference there last Tuesday believe that some people may label Hubei people or report them but also think most people will treat Hubei people with good heart While networks of volunteers and Christian groups have been vocal about offering help many local leaders have focused efforts on finding and isolating people from Hubei On big screens and billboards propaganda videos and posters warn people to stay inside wear masks and wash hands In the northern province of Hebei one county offered bounties of yuan or about for each Wuhan person reported by residents Images online showed towns digging up roads or deputizing men to block outsiders Some apartment building residents barricaded the doors of their towers with China ubiquitous ride share bikes In the eastern province of Jiangsu quarantine turned to imprisonment after authorities used metal poles to barricade shut the door of family recently returned from Wuhan To get food the family relied on neighbors who lowered provisions with rope down to their back balcony according to local news report Scared for the safety of his children as conditions at home worsened Andy Li tech worker from Wuhan traveling with his family in Beijing rented car and began driving south to Guangdong an effort to find refuge with relatives there In Nanjing he was turned away from one hotel before getting room at luxury hotel There he set up self imposed family quarantine for four days until local authorities ordered all people from Wuhan to move to hotel next to the city central rail station Mr Li said the quarantine hotel did not seem to be doing good job isolating people Food delivery workers came and went while gaps in the doors and walls allowed drafts in They re only working to separate Wuhan people from Nanjing people Mr Li said They don care at all if Wuhan people infect each other To help he stuffed towels and tissues under the door to block the drafts m not complaining about the government Mr Li said There will always be loopholes in policy But in selfish way m just really worried about my children Across the country the response from local authorities often resembles the mass mobilizations of the Mao era rather than the technocratic data driven wizardry depicted in propaganda about China emerging surveillance state They have also turned to techniques Beijing used to fight the outbreak of SARS another deadly disease in and when China was much less technologically sophisticated Checkpoints to screen people for fevers have popped up at tollbooths at the front gates of apartment complexes and in hotels grocery stores and train stations Often those wielding the thermometer guns don hold them close enough to person forehead generating unusually low temperature readings Such checks were worthless for instance against one man in the western province of Qinghai whom police are investigating on suspicion that he covered up his symptoms to travel Authorities have used computerized systems that track ID cards which must be used to take most long distance transport and stay in hotels to round up people from Wuhan Yet one article about the ID system in The People Daily the mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party included plea to all passengers on affected flights and trains to report themselves The campaigns have turned life upside down in unexpected ways Jia Yuting year old student in Wuhan

fhw09vo,Thanks for posting From the article In terms of the virus data the number of cumulative deaths reported is described by simple mathematical formula to very high accuracy according to quantitative finance specialist who ran regression of the data for Barron A near perfect of variance is explained by the equation this person said Put in an investing context that variance or so called squared value would mean that an investor could predict tomorrow stock price with almost perfect accuracy In this case the high squared means there is essentially zero unexpected variability in reported cases day after day Barron re created the regression analysis of total deaths caused by the virus which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year and found similarly high variance We ran it by Melody Goodman associate professor of biostatistics at New York University School of Global Public Health have never in my years seen an squared of Goodman says As statistician it makes me question the data Real human data are never perfectly predictive when it comes to something like an epidemic Goodman says since there are countless ways that person could come into contact with the virus For context Goodman says really good squared in terms of public health data would be Anything like she said would make me think that someone is simulating data It would mean you already know what is going to happen There one scenario where the data could be understandably jiggered Goodman said Because there are privacy concerns around public health data it conceivable that someone would simulate the data based on real data so as to make the individuals unidentifiable But even then the squared in this case is extraordinarily high Moreover says Goodman when data are manipulated to protect privacy it would need to be disclosed there is no such disclosure on the WHO site What does this mean for investors and analysts If something seems too good to be true it probably is https www google com amp www barrons com amp articles chinas economic data have always raised questions its coronavirus numbers do too ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
fk6kdle,I a bit concerned with the numbers of official cases of Corona Virus in Japan Two months ago Japan had the second highest number of cases after China and with population of over million people in such densely populated areas and Japan having hyper aged society was certain the situation would become far worse But official figures show that Japan only has around confirmed cases not including diamond princess which is significantly smaller compared to other larger countries with smaller populations such as France Germany Spain etc also heard from many news articles that there are hardly any tests being done on people compared to countries such as Korea and Italy One guy who was recently confirmed with the virus had to go to hospitals before getting test think the number of people infected are far higher than is being reported in Japan but they are not identified due to government bureaucracy or they don want to cancel the olympics which they already spent billions on or both ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
fix1eds,I ve said the entire time the most dangerous thing about this is probably the short lived antibodies and almost nobody talks about it Short lived antibodies and no cross strain immunity might be the BIGGEST deal characteristic of this virus in the long run because it suggests high chance of permanently establishing itself like the flu and other common colds You don seem to form lifelong resistance to coronavirus like you do the flu Flu antibodies stay with you for life Coronavirus antibodies stay with you for months While all viruses mutate and can overcome resistance in SOME viruses each strain builds up total resistance and cities wind up having very diverse resistance due to many people being exposed to many strains over time Antibody resistance is not immunity either Some viruses leave antbodies but they are not enough for meaningful resistance in SOME or most people As of now we should assume some people can get even the same strain of this virus multiple times and with little to no resistance window It may be that applies to the majority of people once you are out past months if not everybody That being said not all corona viruses are the same and perhaps we will get lucky with this one so far m not betting on that because it this little virus is basically an MVP of the apex predator world on paper and it performance in the real world seems to follow that for now It still early in the big picture of global infection and data collection ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

fgpo4jg, amp B This is the biggest shock to oil markets since the Lehman crisis The collapse in Chinese transport and refinery demand has cut imports by three million barrels day some say four million This is twice the UK North Sea oil output An embattled OPEC is having to talk about yet further output cuts horrible surprise as the perpetual petro drought grinds on into its sixth year It now clear that coronavirus is serious event risk to the entire world and that financial conditions are tightening very quickly said Edward Harrison from Credit Writedowns The channel of financial contagion runs from the epidemic through the oil price to bear market rout in the broader energy sector and from there to overstretched US junk bonds High yield is where the rubber hits the road he said The coronavirus is the sort of Black Swan catalyst that the US Treasury Office of Financial Research OFR frets about Its latest stability report said corporate bonds are an accident waiting for such trigger The ratio of junk bonds with debt to earnings ratios above six has reached pc above the pre Lehman peak The number of investment grade securities rated BBB or lower has risen fivefold since many perched just above junk If fear takes hold there is likely to be cascade of downgrades and fallen angels setting off fire sale by bond funds Commodity markets have taken the crisis on the chin because they are instant barometers of actual demand Equity markets are instead shrugging off the Wuhan virus as media noise betting that China factories will reopen on February or thereabouts as Beijing brings the epidemic under control This is brave assumption and can only marvel at analysts suggesting that the infection rate may be tailing off based on each day official data Are they aware of the astonishing accounts of Kafkaesque reality in Wuhan Huanggang and soon no doubt the strong megalopolis of Chongqing where Britain has just closed its consulate Are they reading dispatches from Caixin or in the South China Morning Post revealing desperate shortage of testing kits and tales of the walking afflicted transport has been shut down queuing for hours at hospitals only to be turned away and sent home to die undiagnosed These glimpses of truth are about to vanish The propaganda police have ordered those within their direct reach to conduct an editorial review Stories are being censored aggressively Outsiders will be silenced in subtler ways The coronavirus numbers are patently fiction Far more have died than the official tally of Lancet study last week by the University of Hong Kong estimated that the Chinese authorities have understated the epidemic tenfold This was based on spread rate of per case and doubling in total numbers every days matched with known travel movements within China and globally since the outbreak It calculated even then that the true figure for Wuhan was likely to be and that Chongqing Changsha Nanchang are already riddled with the disease Independent self sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable it said Views differ but it is striking how many global experts when not under political pressure say it may already be too late to stop the spread It very very transmissible and it almost certainly is going to be pandemic says Anthony Fauci head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease It is the same warning from an increasingly alarmed Peter Piot head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine The danger is that it will become endemic and circulate everywhere like flu manageable headwind for rich countries with good health care but Sword of Damocles having over Africa or South Asia There is an inherent contradiction in the market nonchalance Yes it is possible that China million lockdown and use of extreme surveillance and coercive power will accelerate the process of contact tracking catching enough of those infected before they can spread it further Such hi tech totalitarian response to an epidemic has never been tried before But the more thoroughly China enforces this the greater the global economic shock is likely to be How can industrial plants really be reopened next week Yet if it takes another month it becomes progressively harder to contain the international economic damage and raises the risk of Minsky Moment within China own hyper leveraged system keeps rising We are in treacherous waters The People Bank can no longer flick its fingers and ignite instant growth Debt saturation and weak credit demand have furred up the monetary transmission channels Extreme rate cuts and QE with Chinese characteristics would threaten to set of yuan slide and ultimately repeat of the currency crisis For now global markets remain in Pavlovian mode There will always be more Chinese stimulus Uncle Xi will always look after everybody Close China watchers and some very sharp scientists suspect that this latest flurry of optimism is just lull

flectt4, Am making any foolish assumptions don want to call anything you said foolish but the idea that only people would die is very questionable What we need to know and as far as know we don have this answer is what is the no hospital death rate In other words with severely limited access to healthcare how many people will die To me it a very dangerous assumption to say in think based on what m seeing it could easily be quite bit more than per hundred Put it another way the whole point of flattening the curve is not to stamp out the virus It is to ensure that the healthcare system can adequately serve the people who need medical intervention With quality medical intervention the death rate may well be around what you suggest per or so But if we go business as normal the healthcare system is overwhelmed and then we get into triage scenarios as we see in Italy Further if the healthcare system is swamped with coronavirus cases where does that leave you when you get in car accident or fall and break your wrist and so on So far the Bill Gates approach as understand it makes the most sense we need to buy time to ensure that we have the healthcare capacity needed to treat people We also want to get testing ramped up to point where we actually have handle on how many people really have the virus and where they are Eventually we can start loosening restrictions while being able to QUICKLY clamp down in areas where it is needed But to be able to do that we need the leverage provided by testing and healthcare capacity and we are not anywhere close to that yet think Gates and others are right in saying that if we wanted to avoid both severe outbreak and severe economic consequences the time to act was January That ship has sailed nothing to be done about it now We can point fingers and argue and yell but it too late to get ourselves setup in time to mitigate the worst economic effects tend to come down on the side that says it too late to avoid economic disaster It not too late to save millions of lives concede that economic damage will take human toll but think there are lot of strategies we can implement to deal with that look at Denmark plan to freeze the economy This is going to be protracted battle No easy short term solutions here Trump is engaging in VERY DANGEROUS wishful thinking ,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

fhtuvee,part of the article translated amp B The Epoch Times February The Epoch Times reporter Wu Ying compiled the report The new coronavirus that broke out from Wuhan last year had severe epidemic within month So far global scientists have limited understanding of it Yuhong Dong chief scientist of Swiss biotechnology company SunRegen Healthcare AG wrote scientific question about Wuhan new coronavirus Here is the full text The sudden outbreak of Wuhan new coronavirus nCoV spread throughout China and shocked the world This new virus has extremely high transmission speed high basic reproduction number and high lethality characteristics posing an unprecedented huge threat to human beings Due to the limited information currently available from China there is wide gap in the scientific community understanding of the origin of the virus the duration of human to human transmission and the clinical management of infected persons Scientists have recently published research papers on the virus confirming that its origin has nothing to do with genetic recombination in nature and transmission from animals to humans but there are still many difficulties to be further explored Origin of new coronavirus seems to have nothing to do with natural recombination Most papers point out that the similarity between nCoV and bat coronavirus is that of SARS coronavirus is and that of MERS is only Roujian Lu State Key Laboratory of Biosafety National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published paper in The Lancet on January saying natural recombination may not be the cause of the virus On January Greek study analyzed the genetic relationship of nCoV and found that about of the genes of the new coronavirus have no close genetic relationship with other viruses in the sarbecvirus subgenus and have other corona The middle section that the virus does not have These research findings indicate that nCoV is new type of coronavirus overturning the author original assumption that nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses that is they did not evolve naturally High genetic consistency among patients justified recently transmitted to humans nCoV is an RNA virus with high natural mutation rate paper published by Lu Roujian et al In The Lancet states As typical RNA virus the average evolution rate of coronaviruses is about nucleotides per site per year Mutations occur in every replication cycle Therefore it is surprising that the nCoV sequences from different patients described in this paper are almost the same with sequence identity of more than This finding indicates that nCoV is generated from single origin in short period of time and is detected relatively quickly Last week an article in the journal Science said The longer the virus spreads through the population the more time it takes to form mutations that can distinguish strains in infected people and given the analysis found to date The nCoV sequence only detects difference of up to nucleotides which indicates that it has only recently entered the human body However it is still mystery which animal transmitted the virus to humans Bat or South China seafood market not all stories paper published by Lu Roujian in The Lancet also explores the natural host of the new coronavirus First the virus was first reported in late December when most bat species in Wuhan were hibernating Second the South China Seafood Market which sells variety of non aquatic animals including mammals was not sold Bats no bats were found Third the sequence homology between bat SL CoVZC and bat SL CoVZXC of nCoV and its close relatives is less than Therefore the sequences of these two bat coronaviruses are not The direct ancestor of nCoV The authors of the paper point out that although nCoV may initially be lodged on bats the mechanism passed to humans is still mystery In addition paper in the Science magazine also wrote Although the South China seafood market may have played role in the early spread of nCoV it is still questionable whether it is the source of the virus outbreak Although two related study of early cases in Wuhan one of which reported that of the first cases and of the first cases were related to the South China seafood market but as many as of early cases were related to The South China seafood market is irrelevant including some of the earliest cases This increases the likelihood that the new type of coronavirus will initially infect the human body from other sources Spike protein has precise mutations without affecting its affinity for human receptors Each virus must have receptor that binds to human cells and can only live within human cells and must rely on human cells for replication Without these functions viruses that are present in human blood or tissue fluid are easily cleared by the body immune system The virus enters human cells through specific surface protein channels The interaction of viral surface proteins with human cells is similar to unlocking with key Figure cont ending paragraphs in conclusion There are still many scientific questions about this new coronavirus According to recently published scientific paper this new coronavirus has unprecedented virological characteristics suggesting that the virus natural occurrence probability is very rare The virus infection has very severe clinical symptoms and poses huge threat to the entire human race It is imperative that scientists physicians and people around the world including governments and public health authorities make every effort to investigate this suspected virus to understand its origins and protect the future of humanity The scientific difficulties listed in Figure include no close genetic relationship with other coronaviruses similar to SARS binding to human receptors via ACE cytokine storms in patients blood lymphocytes gradually decreasing high reproduction numbers RO human to human transmission Fast high lethality treatment with anti HIV drugs precise selection of site specific mutations while retaining its affinity for the human ACE receptor The writer Dong Yuhong is bachelor of medicine from Beijing Medical University and doctor of infectious diseases from Peking University He has years of working experience in

fgfpbr9,Should be near the top of the page just noticed now that it needs some updating but for now here is the text that there Introduction Unless you have been living under rock you will be aware about the panic surrounding the Novel Coronavirus nCoV pandemic origination from Hubei province in China and in particular originating in Wuhan the capital city of Hubei The city is in complete lockdown since Jan rd This was done to contain the epidemic and prevent further spread of the virus throughout the rest of China and the world will not discuss much further details since this is very well documented by the news media and the internet The problem has been that we the public have so little information to really understand what is really happening Is there real global danger and will the Chinese authorities successfully contain the problem There appears to be lot of fear uncertainty and doubt FUD that is making the whole world very nervous With the very little hard information we have can we estimate the dangers ahead In order to try to shed some light set out to model the behavior of the epidemic In order to create any sort of model we first need to lay out the facts that we know or think we know Further we also need to make some simplifying assumptions So here is what believe we know along with some assumptions The source of the epidemic is believed to be at large seafood and live animal market The initially infected people were directly infected at the market but we do not know Model assumption all initial infections occurred in one place one point in time How many people were infected parameter in the model Over what period did the infection occur see assumption above Was it the only source of infection Only animal to human NO From other locations NO model assumption At first it was thought that human to human transmission may not happen but now we know the following People to people transmission absolutely happens Strong factual evidence The transmission rate is very high What is the transmission rate parameter in the model Worse still the transmission happens before the symptoms appear We do not know how soon after infection transmission can occur parameter in the model It is thought the time from infection to visible symptoms is days parameter in the model How long after full symptoms is an infected person transmitter since they are probably immobile and can only infect family members Since family members are probably already infected we assume person with full symptoms stop being transmitter after some short number of days parameter in the model Many believe that China is under reporting the number of infected individuals This is highly likely not because of nefarious reason but because It is reported that the hospitals in Wuhan and Hubei are so overwhelmed that staff have asked the public seek hospital treatment only if they are almost dying Coronavirus is only being reported after confirmation test have verified it We must estimate what percent of the infected population are going to the hospital and have been tested parameter in the model We do not know how many days from the initial infection to full recovery no longer able to transmit the disease This too is parameter in the model The Model The main objective of the model is to keep it as simple as possible while still providing useful and fairly accurate results So many simplifying assumptions are made and they will be explained as to get to them HTML The model core is an array of numbers each cell represents day from the start of the infection The length of the array is the number of days from the start of the infection to the end The value is each call is the number of people at that stage of the infection The people is cell are the ones initially infected Each simulated day the vales of the cell is moved to the right next cell index The value in the last cell is dropped e the person no longer has the illness Newly infected people are added to cell The number of deaths are so small that the simplifying assumption the dead are left in the array The stages of infection Note parameter is coloured in purple These values can be adjusted to match known values more of this will be explained later Newly infected people in cell People in cell becomeSpreader can transmit infection to others This value is parameter we can set The parameter daysAsSpreader for how many days the infected person can spread the infection to others So all the people from cells becomeSpreader to becomeSpreader daysAsSpreader can create new infections This period is known as spread period person must be spreader at least until they are at the visible symptoms symptomsAppear day Although this restriction is not enforced in the model The number of people each person in the spread period cells is given by the parameter infectPerDay So the number of new infections per simulated day is given by the total number of people in the spread period cells infectiousPeople times infectPerDay The cell day symptomsAppear is when the infected person shows visible symptoms e the person feels sick and knows he or she is ill The next cell is the number of days administrativeDelay from symptomsAppear to the infection being recorded by the authorities Since we know not everybody that can be recorded is not so we have another parameter

fjhn510,I a year old living near Chicago and have so many questions If there million people in Wuhan and only people have gotten corona there the odds seem pretty good that you won catch it even if you are in Wuhan right Or if there are only so many cases in Italy and Iran then why does everyone coming back from those places seem to have gotten it Why is the US acting like everything is under control The flu is worse Is it an attempt to save the stock market Or is this truly like the flu Then what with the hazmat suits Last time checked they don break the hazmat suits out over the flu Even if they magically come with vaccine in the coming weeks won we basically be guinea pigs The face mask won help don buy them We need them for the hospital personnel So they work for Drs but not us Why does everyone in China wear one then Will this evolve into something worse over time How does Coronavirus affect smoker m confused shouldn the best containment method be to start quarantine on the cities and towns that have it Or are we just going to ride it out until the situation is out of control If barely anyone in the US has been tested for it but yet there a bunch of people who have it aren they just spreading it around everywhere Let me guess we ll find out in two weeks right Why would anyone with mild case of Coronavirus actually go to hospital only to be put under quarantine especially those who can afford medical With that being said how the ll are we supposed to contain this thing If this is just the flu why do keep seeing youngish Drs dying from this Again m confused m starting to think that the US is just going to let it ride out until the situation truly becomes out of control We have perfect examples already of places where it become out of control and here we are acting like it the flu This is so confusing Not to mention half of the people know are taking this as joke laughing at memes on fb about it This just goes to show how much misleading information is truly out there Maybe if you re you ll be fine or maybe you won Even if chances are good that you ll be okay what about your parents Aren you worried about them catching it When will people wake tf up ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fkm562m,Looking back this was probably very good thing even though it consumed so much of the state resources The NBA suspending its season was the first big domino that fell prompting massive chain reaction of cancellations by sports leagues cities and states They jumpstarted corona concern in the US because in matter of hours really we went from passive perusing to pure panicking too was initially critical about the Utah Jazz special privileged access to testing but thinking back believe we should be thanking the league for being as bold and aggressive as they were They catapulted movement and saved tremendous number of lives due to the snowballing effects of social distancing they created Who knows how long it would have taken the country to get to this point if the NBA hadn cancelled the season when they did How many lives would that have cost us in the end Remember NBA arenas can hold about ppl Multiply that by up to games day gets you to attendance day So Even if you want to argue that they had no influence on anything else shutting down which come on you can deny that everyone saw that and was like woahhhh they singlehandedly prevented potential cases each day They really deserve credit for that In cases of exponential growth like with corona containing it in the earliest days are critical and leads to many lives saved down the line So yes even though they did kind of monopolize testing strongly believe that the alternative would have been far worse in the end Thank you Adam Silver But also fuck you rudy gobert for being so irresponsible and making fool of yourself ,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

fjqxzz0,Unpopular opinion The strategy the world has right now is not feasible and my cents are that we need to stop quarantines and start only treating the seriously ill know this sounds like heartless suggestion and realize some people will yell But people will DIE at me But hear me out Quarantine measures are not working Trying everything to contain the virus was without question the right move when we were talking about mostly one region in China and couple of very isolated cases worldwide But sadly we have passed that point There just is no way of containing it anymore At large scale quarantining everyone is not doable We re already at the point where some medical workers here in Germany have been diagnosed In theory EVERYONE who had contact with them in the last days needs to be quarantined That pretty much whole hospital Are we seriously suggesting shutting down hospitals We are choking the medical system We just don have the resources neither staff nor material to test half the population quarantine large share all while considerable percentage of the medical community is missing themselves Cases are already being reported where patients with severe health problems aren getting the care they need because the medical system is overwhelmed The longer this lasts the more incredible the economic consequences will be Don get me wrong don give rat ass about the stock market But with people literally closing down pretty much everything where large amount of people meet large percentage of businesses are already suffering immensely Quite few experts are already warning that this is sparking the next global financial crisis and the impacts of that is probably worse for most than the illness itself My suggestion This is something that no single government would be likely to implement for fear of their population saying they re not doing all they can In my opinion the WHO needs to step forward and say Ok guys we tried containing it which clearly hasn worked out Everyone stop the quarantining Mild cases just stay home like they do with flu severe cases obviously get treated PS Again know this sounds little heartless Somebody granny will die and they blame people like me for not caring assure you do care m absolutely for doing everything possible But quarantining everyone at some point just isn possible anymore And m very worried that the consequences of basically shutting down more and more vital parts of our medical services and our economic systems in general with have far more devastating impact than corona itself ,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
fj63yg5,I getting tired of people saying that this is not big deal because flu kills more people or because SARS had higher mortality rate so here are some facts We don decide how deadly disease is by comparing it to another if it is capable of killing someone it taken seriously and rightly so Flu kills more people because it infects more people If this spreads as much as the flu does this would kill the same if not more people We do not have vaccine for this we do for the flu We do not have curative treatment that works across the board for flu we have specific anti virals known to work There is reason why the CDC and WHO are working this hard to contain this please listen to what they say and not some random keyboard warrior that wants to feel superior by telling everyone it no big deal flu kills thousands By that logic you don need cage when going cage diving with sharks because thousands of people die in car crashes And d like to see these guys say this is not big deal to the family members who already watched their loved ones die So when hear these dumbasses talk about how it not big deal it just irks me given that you literally have the CDC say gt On January the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak public health emergency of international concernexternal icon PHEIC m not saying this is time to panic that not helpful under any circumstance but let just be prepared and start practicing good hand hygiene and some common sense ve linked the first video found on Youtube when searched for hygiene practices from WHO https youtu be gKEMaVYarFk so presume it available to all and is not country blocked It also got the little youtube description about Coronavirus under it so guess it legit If not just follow CDC and WHO directly for the up to date advice Following this advice will also reduce the transmission of normal flu since it flu season in many parts of the world and so naturally this will also help save lives that would have been lost to the usual annual flu ,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
flc73lq,Let start with that first question do you have to come in contact with someone who has the virus or with droplets they are spraying from cough or sneeze to catch it Well that almost certainly the easiest way to get it So keeping your distance from others greatly reduces your risk of infection But in study out this week in the New England Journal of Medicine researchers at Montana biohazard lab run by the National Institutes of Health confirmed what many experts had feared this coronavirus can also be infectious outside of living body in some cases for days The other night watched the movie Contagion which certainly has some eerie parallels to the present There a scene where Kate Winslet character CDC disease investigator explains why that kind of durability is so troubling in virus audio from clip from Contagion KW So at this point think we have to believe this is respiratory maybe fomites too What that fomites It refers to transmission from surfaces The average person touches their face two or three thousand times day three to five times every waking minute In between we re touching doorknobs water fountains elevator buttons and each other Those things become fomites The I researchers tested whether the SARS CoV virus can spread via fomites which by the way is how you actually pronounce it They sprayed infectious droplets onto cardboard stainless steel and plastic Then they checked the spatter as time passed to see how quickly the viral particles dried out and fell apart On cardboard it took good four hours before the amount of live virus started to fall significantly and the surface remained quite infectious eight hours later So when an Amazon box appeared on my front porch couple days ago was glad to see that the delivery man was wearing gloves But after opened the box still went to the sink and washed my hands On stainless steel think railings shopping carts gas pumps jungle gyms the coronavirus remained infectious for more than day And on plastic so our pens our credit cards our keyboards and keypads it stayed viable for two to three days Here in the Seattle area store managers and bus operators have been wiping down surfaces more frequently and making disinfecting wipes available at the door for customers to use We now know that should be standard practice everywhere Inside that box received from Amazon was set of white cotton gloves that had ordered for me and my family to wear when we go out Tests have shown that standard face mask really doesn protect you from catching this virus because so much of the air you inhale leaks in around the edges rather than going through the filter Wearing mask is nice courtesy though if you re going to be around others who may be vulnerable But pulmonary surgeon advised me to wear cotton gloves as they do at his hospital because the natural fibers trap the virus and it dries out and becomes inactive Also find that wearing gloves helps me remember to avoid touching my face So we can get infected from people we never even see from the fomites they leave behind But now let turn to that second question can you catch COVID from someone who hasn tested positive or even from someone who may feel perfectly healthy Studies seem to confirm that the answer is yes In paper that appeared on March th in the journal Science an international group of researchers analyzed data on the outbreak in China in January They concluded that only of COVID infections were documented meaning that that six out of seven cases never showed up in the statistics as confirmed case Here what Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University one of the authors of that paper said about that in news briefing last week JS These undocumented infections were about half as infectious per person as documented case who has more severe symptoms and maybe shedding more Because however there are many more of these undocumented cases it the undocumented infections that are driving the spread and growth of the outbreak Shaman says these undocumented cases are mostly quite mild JS And so most people may not recognize that they may think they have another cold or they may not even really recognize that they re ill If you were to project that number globally given that we have confirmed cases it says that we re approaching close to million infections globally Generally you re looking at about an order of magnitude more cases than have been confirmed VO Of course every day the count of confirmed cases rises But the idea is that if you take the count today and multiply by seven that a more realistic estimate of the number of infections to date So who is transmitting the virus Obviously people who are very sick and have tested positive Plus maybe seven times more people many of them young who have caught it but feel well enough that they wouldn think to get tested or to self quarantine And then there a third group the fast increasing numbers of people who are infected and who five or ten days from now will fall ill and become confirmed case but who feel perfectly fine at the moment In preprint article published on March th researchers with the World Health Organization studied COVID patients in Guangzhou China to determine when they became infectious and when they stopped shedding the virus The scientists collected throat swabs from the patients as soon as they began showing symptoms and then tested them again every day for the following month They saw lot of variation from patient to patient But overall the patients tended to become less infectious as their symptoms progressed Through some calculations the scientists concluded that these coronavirus patients shed the most virus and were probably most infectious to others up to two days before they started feeling ill So these are people like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky who we learned on March nd has tested positive for COVID even though he isn yet feeling any symptoms These H researchers estimate that around half of the people who caught this virus in Guangzhou got it from someone who was still feeling healthy at the time And other studies from China have documented cases where patients have fully recovered from COVID but continued to test positive for the virus for more than week after their symptoms disappeared This phenomenon of pre symptomatic and post symptomatic transmission really complicates efforts to contain this virus in particular because it will be long time before we have enough coronavirus tests to check people who aren yet showing symptoms In move to help ease shortages of coronavirus tests the S Food and Drug Administration last week gave emergency authorization to hospitals and labs to use new automated test for COVID that can detect infections in minutes rather than days Cepheid biotech company in California says it will start shipping the test kits this week The Cepheid test performs essentially the same real time PCR process that existing tests do just much faster says Cepheid Chief Medical Officer David Persing DP So what we ve developed is reference lab quality test that can be run at the point of care in about minutes or less You take sample put it into this new cartridge that we ve developed and about minutes later you ll have the result And that test can be run at the hospital as patients are being admitted So the results are available much more quickly And that means that those results will play into how those patients are managed who gets respiratory isolation Who needs antibiotics who doesn need antibiotics Those kinds of decisions can be made in real time Persing says that while the test could be used for screening in the community and may be sensitive enough to detect pre symptomatic super shedders initially it will be available only for hospitals to use on their patients and healthcare workers DP We think this will be very important tool in being able to get rapid actionable results to let patients know if they re carriers even if they re asymptomatic to quarantine And to know that they re being quarantined for reason not because they may have hay fever or some other cause but really give them reason for quarantine Faster easier tests should help us get better handle on the true extent of this pandemic But these tests aren perfect number of studies including one done by scientists at Wuhan University in February have found that these RT PCR tests we re relying on today aren sensitive enough to reliably catch the infection in its early stages So negative test result is no guarantee that you re not carrying the virus Nor does it tell you whether or not you are immune to the disease But new tests for immunity are coming These characteristics of the new coronavirus it ability to lie in wait on surfaces and to spread easily among people who feel fine or well enough that is what make this virus so contagious and hard to stop as Elizabeth Halloran of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center explained at news briefing last week EH the basic reproductive number that is the average number of people that an average person infects at the beginning is estimated to be about And there are actually estimates that are higher That before of course all this behavioral reduction and social distancing which would reduce it But it going to be difficult even if it does go down somewhat seasonally in the summer to bring that down necessarily below one ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

fl8ke7u, Italy Pandemic New Epicenter Has Lessons for the World The country experience shows that steps to isolate the coronavirus and limit people movement need to be put in place early with absolute clarity then strictly enforced By Jason Horowitz Emma Bubola and Elisabetta Povoledo ROME As Italy coronavirus infections ticked above cases and deaths hit the double digits the leader of the governing Democratic Party posted picture of himself clinking glasses for an aperitivo in Milan urging people not to change our habits That was on Feb Not days later as the toll hit infections and dead the party boss Nicola Zingaretti posted new video this time informing Italy that he too had the virus Italy now has more than recorded infections and more than dead and the rate of increase keeps growing with more than half the cases and fatalities coming in the past week On Saturday officials reported additional deaths by far the largest single day increase so far Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll becoming the epicenter of shifting pandemic The government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in Lombardy the northern region at the center of the outbreak where bodies have piled up in churches On Friday night the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown closing parks banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home On Saturday night Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced another drastic step in response to what he called the country most difficult crisis since the Second World War Italy will close its factories and all production that is not absolutely essential an enormous economic sacrifice intended to contain the virus and protect lives The state is here he said in an effort to reassure the public But the tragedy of Italy now stands as warning to its European neighbors and the United States where the virus is coming with equal velocity If Italy experience shows anything it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early put in place with absolute clarity then strictly enforced Despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy Italy piecemeal attempts to cut it off isolating towns first then regions then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown always lagged behind the virus lethal trajectory Now we are running after it said Sandra Zampa the under secretary at the Ministry of Health who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had We closed gradually as Europe is doing France Spain Germany the S are doing the same Every day you close bit you give up on bit of normal life Because the virus does not allow normal life Some officials gave in to magical thinking reluctant to make painful decisions sooner All the while the virus fed on that complacency Governments beyond Italy are now in danger of following the same path repeating familiar mistakes and inviting similar calamity And unlike Italy which navigated uncharted territory for Western democracy other governments have less room for excuses Italian officials for their part have defended their response emphasizing that the crisis is unprecedented in modern times They assert that the government responded with speed and competence immediately acting on the advice of its scientists and moving more swiftly on drastic economically devastating measures than their European counterparts But tracing the record of their actions shows missed opportunities and critical missteps In the critical early days of the outbreak Mr Conte and other top officials sought to down play the threat creating confusion and false sense of security that allowed the virus to spread They blamed Italy high number of infections on aggressive testing of people without symptoms in the north which they argued only created hysteria and tarnished the country image abroad Even once the Italian government considered universal lockdown necessary to defeat the virus it failed to communicate the threat powerfully enough to persuade Italians to abide by the rules which seemed riddled with loopholes It is not easy in liberal democracy said Walter Ricciardi World Health Organization board member and top adviser to the health ministry who argued that the Italian government acted on the scientific evidence made available to it He said the Italian government had moved at much faster clip and took the threat much more seriously than its European neighbors or the United States Still he acknowledged that the health minister had struggled to persuade his government colleagues to move more quickly and that the difficulties of navigating Italy division of powers between Rome and the regions resulted in fragmented chain of command and inconsistent messages In times of war like an epidemic that system presented grave problems he said adding that it perhaps delayed the imposing of restrictive measures would have done them days before that is the only difference It Could Never Happen Here For the coronavirus days can be lifetime On Jan as top Chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity Italy culture and tourism minister hosted Chinese delegation for concert at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to inaugurate the year of Italy China Culture and Tourism Michele Geraci Italy former under secretary in the economic development ministry and booster of closer relations with China had drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily Are we sure we want to do this he said he asked them Should we be here today With the benefit of hindsight Italian officials say certainly not Ms Zampa the health ministry under secretary said in retrospect she would have closed everything immediately But in real time it wasn that clear Politicians across the spectrum worried about the economy and feeding the country and found it difficult to accept their impotence in the face of the virus Most importantly Italy looked at the example of China Ms Zampa said not as practical warning but as science fiction movie that had nothing to do with us And when the virus exploded Europe she said looked at us the same way we looked at China But already in January some officials on the right were urging Mr Conte their former ally and now political enemy to quarantine schoolchildren in the northern regions who were returning from holidays in China measure aimed at protecting schools Many of those children were from Chinese immigrant families Many liberals criticized the proposal as populist fear mongering Mr Conte declined the proposal and responded that the northern governors should trust the judgment of education and health authorities who he said had proposed no such thing But Mr Conte also demonstrated that he was taking the threat of contagion seriously On Jan he blocked all flights in and out of China We are the first country in Europe to adopt such precautionary measure he said Over the next month Italy responded swiftly to coronavirus scares Two sick Chinese tourists and an Italian returning from China received care from prominent infectious disease hospital in Rome false alarm led authorities to briefly confine passengers on cruise ship docked outside of Rome Patient One Super spreader When year old man went to the emergency room at hospital in Codogno small town in the Lodi province of Lombardy with severe flu symptoms on Feb the case did not set off alarms The patient declined to be hospitalized and went home He got sicker and returned to the hospital few hours later and was admitted to general medicine ward On Feb he went into intensive care where he tested positive for the virus The man who became known as Patient One had had busy month He attended at least three dinners played soccer and ran with team all apparently while contagious and without heavy symptoms Mr Ricciardi said Italy had the bad luck of having super spreader in densely populated and dynamic area who went to the hospital not once but twice infecting hundreds of people including doctors and nurses He was incredibly active Mr Ricciardi said But he also had not had any direct contacts with China and experts suspect he contracted the virus from another European meaning Italy did not have an identifiable patient zero or traceable source of contagion that could help it contain the virus The virus had already been active in Italy for weeks by that time experts now say passed by people without symptoms and often mistaken for flu It spread around Lombardy the Italian region that has by far the most trade with China and the home of Milan the country most culturally vibrant and business centered city Who we call Patient One was

fkj51r0,I should be qualified to comment on the covid pandemic m computational system biologist working on infectious diseases and have spent five years in world class pandemic response modelling unit In this thread will summarise what believe don know After having spent considerable time thinking how to mitigate and manage this pandemic and analysing the available data failed to identify the best course of action Even worse m not sure there is such thing as an acceptable solution to the problem we are facing believe that the covid pandemic is the most serious global public health threat humanity faced since the influenza pandemic There are major differences between the two events but suspect there will also be similarities that may emerge once we look back The most plausible scenario to me is for the covid pandemic to wane in the late spring in the Northern hemisphere and come back as second wave in the winter which expect could be even worse than what we re facing now Pic below is what happened in Predictions from any model are only as good as the data that parametrised it There are two major unknowns at this stage We don know to what extent covid transmission will be seasonal We don know if covid infection induces long lasting immunity Seasonality is difficult to predict without time series Comparison between regions for the covid pandemic suggests some seasonality but likely less than for influenza This would be roughly in line with other Coronaviridae common cold and MERS How long immunity lasts for following covid infection is the biggest unknown Comparison with other Coronaviridae suggests it may be relatively short lived e months If this were to be confirmed it would add to the challenge of managing the pandemic Short lived immunisation would defeat both flattening the curve and herd immunity approaches Devising an effective strategy would be even more challenging under low seasonal forcing It would also considerably complicate effective vaccination campaigns The covid pandemic is an extremely challenging problem and there are still many unknowns There is no simple fix and poorly thought out interventions could make the situation even worse massively so The covid pandemic is not just an epidemiological problem It is Global Health problem that can only be tackled with an integrated and global approach For example there is no such thing as choice between managing the pandemic vs protecting the economy Health and the economy are closely linked The correlation between per capita GDP and health life expectancy is essentially perfect If the covid pandemic leads to global economy collapse many more lives will be lost than covid would ever be able to claim ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
fl32bys,I do appreciate the honesty grew up in the UK though ve lived in the US for about years and guess have somewhat had it drilled into me since history lessons as kid that there are these kind of hallmarks of authoritarian leaders throughout history from the left or right that are really easy to spot like de legitimizing the free and critical press blaming real problems on minority scapegoat populations and using dehumanizing rhetoric to describe them subverting the legal system to go after political opponents in the name of fighting corruption and so on and so on Even installing family members and other unqualified cronies into high positions of government power To me it seems like Trump checked all these boxes so the mixture of outrage and frankly fear coupled with mystification about how anyone could like him was absolutely real mean since the impeachment acquittal he literally been joking about abolishing term limits and making himself president for life right Surely even as fan of his that got to be raising some alarm bells know the defense is that he kidding but m not sure what the punchline is Oh look at people getting upset by me pretending to be dictator in waiting It nuts suppose it is all triggering to me for couple of reasons Firstly because find it genuinely scary and secondly because it makes me realize how naive was to assume that we all see ourselves as basically on the same side as Americans with just different ideas about how to achieve broadly shared goals suppose don or rather didn used to think of myself as partisan My instincts are broadly liberal and d basically always vote Democratic but not through some sort of self identity just because generally felt that the pendulum between completely unfettered free market capitalism which can lead to Dickensian England and stifling regulation and self defeating union power which can lead to depressed England is currently swung too far to the right as evidenced by the massive levels of income and wealth inequality But basically felt that we re all looking for the same goals safety opportunity fairness treating people decently strong economy opportunities for all etc but just have different opinions about how to get there didn vote for McCain or Romney for example and would have disagreed strongly with their policy agenda but would feel like we were at least living in the same reality and they were motivated by doing their best for all of us to the best of their ability But with Trump it just crazy As you said yourself his talent seems to be making people outraged about nothing Whenever there an opportunity or need to unify the country he will take the opposite tack and do his best to drive wedge between us mean look at this dumb China Virus thing People are looking for leadership in time of national crisis He starts using this term China virus and people suggest it may be seen as unnecessarily divisive or racist or whatever So he responds by essentially saying Yeah People don like it Fuck you and using it exclusively Really how hard would it be for him to make it non story by just saying Coronavirus COVID Chinese Virus Wuhan flu call it what you like here are the steps we re taking to try to make everyone safe suppose leaving left right politics aside m looking for decent empathetic and capable president Someone who inspires people to come together for the common good and treat each other with respect Someone you can earnestly and honestly look up to as role model suppose m looking for old school TNG Star Trek where we work together to forge bright future Obviously we re never going to get exactly that but it the ideal Obama was close perhaps have my criticisms of his presidency but believe he did have basic decency in spades Frankly so did McCain liked Buttigieg lot in the primary but he unsurprisingly didn make it have always assumed that ultimately everyone else feels the same way but seeing Trump win the presidency and seeing his divisiveness cheered on has revealed how naive that is It pretty damn bleak honestly And hope against hope that he doesn win another term and we don have to discover whether the president for life jokes should have been taken more seriously now that he seems to have complete and absolute control of the GOP ,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

fl18dts,Trump is hands down without doubt the worst president this country has ever had It not even debatable Sure we could look at all of his lies cruelty narcissism ignorance appallingly stupid tweets and other personal idiosyncrasies that inarguably reveal him to be an irredeemably horrible person but this ultimately doesn matter What matters are his policies and his performance as president In that regard he really is inexcusably awful Consider the following His tax policy overwhelmingly favors the wealthy and blasted massive hole in the deficit he assumed magical growth would account for it but this magical thinking failed to materialize in reality This was absolutely foolish and downright corrupt On this note he spends most of his time golfing or watching TV while whining about how hard he works Meanwhile he spent more tax payer dollars shuttling himself and his gross family around to vacation hotspots than any other president before him He campaigned on getting us out of war but he not only kept us in the wars he expanded them and further entrenched us He openly bragged about using US troops as mercenaries to protect Saudi Arabia he continuing the genocide in Yemen he continuing the shadow wars in Africa he ramped up drone bombing and civilian death massively until they just stopped reported the numbers because it got so bad and he brags about the billions of dollars in weapons he sells to murderous dictators His attempted peace deal in Afghanistan didn even involve the Afghan government and immediately collapsed His negotiations with North Korea amounted to cowardly capitulation with nothing in return He an incompetent negotiator whose massively weakening the US on the world stage Alongside Mitch McConnell they re working to stack the judiciary with young hard right radical Christian judges which will deform the judicial branch into some kind of hateful Christian supremacist rubber stamp for an executive branch that been given way way too much power This is one of the most extreme and long term dangerous aspects of his presidency Trump has fascist authoritarian mentality already and he destroying the norms of democratic governance to reshape the executive branch into more unitary authoritarian position It fundamentally anti democratic His environmental record is criminally destructive Because he chasing after economic growth at all costs he removing protections for endangered species he removing protections for streams and waterways he shrinking protected areas and monuments he opening up protected areas to oil drilling and mining and he removing pollution standards even though pollution causes premature death birth defects brain damage in children and increases respiratory and cardiovascular diseases across the board His treatment of the environment is downright evil Now we re living in pandemic that his actions directly encouraged Trump attempted to defund the CDC but was stopped by Congress but he succeeded in disbanding the pandemic response teams which were full of experts who would have been able to lead better response to the coronavirus The initial handling of the outbreak under the orders of the administration was clusterfuck of incompetence and ignorance and now that it gotten out of control Trump demonstrates his complete inability to lead by explicitly denying all responsibility It almost like he wants to brutalize Americans he stated his intent to cut Medicare and Social Security to kick hundreds of thousands off of food stamps during pandemic and denial of disaster funds to states that don support him politically The only reason these things haven come to pass is because judges appointed by better Presidents are there to put down nationwide injuctions to stop this madness Only Trump wants to get rid of that ability so judges can stop his worst EOs from harming millions This is all just off the top of my head but there so much more We could talk about him appointing unqualified religious radicals into positions of power or defunding public schools in favor of worse performing worse outcomes charter schools or his clear humanitarian abuses at the border kids kept in cages and injected with psychotropic drugs for example or his dismantling of our alliances with Europe or his complete disregard for all international attempts at responding to climate change Trump is President who would destroy his grandchildren future to make himself bit more money today ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fkei1z8,Here you go booboo did this one my phone so sorry if formatting is off WASHINGTON Despite mounting pleas from California and other states the Trump administration isn allowing states to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the coronavirus crisis by expanding medical services In previous emergencies including the terrorist attacks Hurricane Katrina and the N flu outbreak both Republican and Democratic administrations loosened Medicaid rules to empower states to meet surging needs But months into the current global disease outbreak the White House and senior federal health officials haven taken the necessary steps to give states simple pathways to fully leverage the mammoth safety net program to prevent wider epidemic That making it harder for states to quickly sign up poor patients for coverage so they can get necessary testing or treatment if they are exposed to coronavirus And it threatens to slow efforts by states to bring on new medical providers set up emergency clinics or begin quarantining and caring for homeless Americans at high risk from the virus If they wanted to do it they could do it said Cindy Mann who oversaw the Medicaid program in the Obama administration and worked with states to help respond to the N crisis in https www latimes com archives la xpm apr na napolitano story html One reason federal health officials have not acted appears to be President Trump reluctance to declare national emergency That a key step that would clear the way for states to get Medicaid waivers to more nimbly tackle coronavirus but it would conflict with Trump repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the epidemic https www latimes com politics story trump coronavirus response spotlights administration weaknesses Another element may be ideological The administration official who oversees Medicaid Seema Verma head of the government Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been champion of efforts by conservative states https www latimes com politics story trump plan reshape medicaid with block grants to trim the number of people enrolled in Medicaid The steps that California Washington and other states hit hard by the epidemic want to take would likely increase the number of people enrolled in the program Medicaid could be the nation biggest public health responder but it such an object of ire in this administration said Sara Rosenbaum Medicaid expert at George Washington University Their ideology is clouding their response to crisis In response to questions about how her agency known as CMS is handling state concerns Verma office noted that the agency is trying to assist states providing answers to frequently asked questions and hosting nationwide calls with state health officials The agency noted that some waivers are not possible because Trump hasn declared national emergency Waivers cannot be invoked until and unless there is Presidential Stafford Act declaration the agency noted saying that it was prepared to exercise that authority should it become available Medicaid the half century old government safety net program and the related Children Health Insurance Program provide health insurance to more than million low income Americans https www latimes com politics la na pol uninsured children story html many of whom gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act To control fraud the program has extensive rules dictating who is eligible and what kinds of medical services can be covered federal officials can penalize states that don scrutinize who receives

that it would grant waivers https www medicaid gov sites default files Federal Policy Guidance downloads SHO pdf so they could rapidly enroll people into Medicaid who had been displaced by the storm

health experts fear that gaps in insurance coverage make controlling coronavirus more difficult because patients who don have insurance won seek medical attention and testing they fear they can afford

fke0lkg,I ll give it go All cells have proteins on their surface which have many purposes one of which is to allow cells to recognise each other Your immune system recognises all your own proteins at least when its working properly and it recognises ones that are foreign When say recognise it is quite binary thing it says either self or not self and responds either okay move on or not okay exterminate When it finds foreign cell it needs to let the rest of your immune system know that theres something wrong here It does that by engineering small protein called an antibody On one end the protein mirrors the shape of the protein so it fits together bit like puzzle piece that antibody cant work for any other protein The other end is signal to your immune system that its attached to something you dont want Your immune system ramps up production of these antibodies which then go and stick to all the foreign cells These covered cells are removed from your body in various ways Job done extermination achieved This sounds great but the only way your body can develop these antibodies is through exposure to foreign organism You dont have immunity that first time you re exposed only from the second time That basically how vaccines work you give someone dose of little bits of dead organisms so it cant hurt you and then your body can recognise those surface proteins and make antibodies in case you re ever re exposed to it That how they are looking to make safe Coronavirus vaccine which may or may not be possible viruses evolve regularly so it may turn out to be bit like the flu vaccine and not protect against all strains but that jumping the gun to suggest whether that will or wont be possible at this stage at least for us who aren involved in the actual making Viruses are sneaky though and they usually have ways to get around this HIV is good example what it does is get inside your white blood cells so its effectively hidden from view Coronavirus enters your body through your respiratory system and more specifically it travels into your system by hijacking protein on the surface of the cells that line your airways The protein is called ACE Once it in your cell it causes all the mischief Vaccines are just one way we could try and get immunity another way would be monoclonal antibody Monoclonal just means loads of clones of the exact same thing think thousands of Dolly the Sheep or Stormtroopers All genetically exactly the same Monoclonal antibodies mAbs for short are used in medicine in lots of ways most people are most familiar with them in the setting of cancer treatment if your drug ends with mab then it one of these What scientists are doing from the articles ve read caveat fairly brief reading on my part and fairly limited info on the articles part is that they ve taken serum samples take blood test take out the actual blood cells red and white and you re left with the proteins that circulate in your blood normally including you guessed it antibodies from people who ve had and recovered from coronavirus Their immune system has already made its antibodies and now the scientists have copy What they can do is clone these antibodies and make millions of copies and then it could be available as an infusion to give to people who were infected and unwell It isnt without its risks and it is probably hideously expensive but could he really useful tool for certain patients to help them recover The advantage of mAb over vaccine is that you dont have time delay while you re waiting for your body to make the antibodies they just storm right on in and get to work The potential disadvantage is that once you ve made an antibody this gets committed to your memory bank of antibodies You have basically whole library of antibodies to every virus you ve ever had exposure to many of which will be common or garden variety coronaviruses actually With mAb you dont get this memory dont think we know enough about this virus yet to know whether that an issue Many viruses never truly leave us they just chill out somewhere hidden often for years and years but can flare up again This is why cold cores happen you ve had the herpesvirus before it never truly gone away but mostly enters steady state where your immune system continues to produce antibodies to it to keep it under wraps When you re run down or your immune system is compromised for whatever reason that balance is disrupted and the virus wins out for while and your cold sore flare up again MAbs hang around for quite while but not forever so you dont have long term immunity hope that helps little bit and that it makes sense ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fku63pe,I noticed this post shared on Facebook the source of the information seems dubious but the science at least to my microbiology undergrad trained eye seems to check out Thoughts or critiques about the science from anyone here don care to get into the pros cons of Facebook information sourcing AN EXPLANATION from microbiologist at the CDC Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is bigger deal than seasonsl flu Here it is in nutshell hope this helps Feel free to share this to others who don understand It has to do with RNA sequencing e genetics Seasonal flu is an all human virus The DNA RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year you get immunity two ways through exposure to virus or by getting flu shot Novel viruses come from animals the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals sometimes for years watching for mutations Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal pigs in the case of N birds in the case of the Spanish flu But once one of these animal viruses mutates and starts to transfer from animals to humans then it a problem Why Because we have no natural or acquired immunity the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn human and the human immune system doesn recognize it so we can fight it off Now sometimes the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human for years it only transmission is from an infected animal to human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human once that happens we have new contagion phase And depending on the fashion of this new mutation thats what decides how contagious or how deadly it gonna be N was deadly but it did not mutate in way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu It RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently too Fast forward Now here comes this Coronavirus it existed in animals only for nobody knows how long but one day at an animal market in Wuhan China in December it mutated and made the jump from animal to people At first only animals could give it to person But here is the scary part in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human Scientists call this quick ability slippery This Coronavirus not being in any form human virus whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity Took off like rocket And this was because humans have no known immunity doctors have no known medicines for it And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus changed itself in such way the way that it causes great damage to human lungs That why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu or N or any other type of influenza this one is slippery AF And it a lung eater And it already mutated AGAIN so that we now have two strains to deal with strain and strain which makes it twice as hard to develop vaccine We really have no tools in our shed with this History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu Factoid Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him till the Black Plague passed honestly understand him so much better now Just like us he had no tools in his shed except social isolation And let me end by saying right now it hitting older folks harder but this genome is so slippery if it mutates again and it will Who is to say what it will do next flattenthecurve https www facebook com hashtag flattenthecurve source feed text amp epa HASHTAG Stay home folks or simply away from others who may be carrying it if you can be outdoors somewhere and share this to those that just are not catching on ,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
fkoc8bi,Transcribed and translated to English amp B Good evening The corona virus is gripping our country Us and the rest of the world Together we are faced with task of enormous size Many people will recognize the feeling that we have been on rollercoaster in recent weeks that seems to be getting faster and faster You wonder is this really happening Because the measures taken here and elsewhere are unprecedented for peacetime countries At the beginning of this speech would like to express my condolences to the families of those who have since died of the virus wish everyone who is in the hospital or who is recovering at home wish them lot of improvement and strength And want to address the elderly and those with poor health realize that you are very concerned And that is why want to tell you that our absolute priority is to minimize the risks for you With all the news from home and abroad with all events that follow each other at breakneck speed it makes perfect sense that there are very broad concerns in society We all have questions What can do to protect myself and those around me What about school and work Can children party continue family weekend wedding How long will this all take And why does one country take different measures than another In today world news and information are faster than light and an opinion is also given quickly understand that But the answer to all the questions that come to life starts with the knowledge and experience of experts Let us hold on to that To experts such as Jaap van Dissel and his colleagues inside and outside RIVM Virologists intensive care physicians and other specialists From the beginning their advice has guided all measures that have been taken in the Netherlands so far And it is important that we continue to rely on that compass of scientific knowledge and reliable facts That is the only sensible way to continue taking the necessary steps Steps that inevitably come our way Because don have an easy message for you tonight The reality is that the coronavirus is among us and will remain among us for the time being There is no easy or quick way out of this very difficult situation The reality is also that large part of the Dutch population will become infected with the virus in the near future That what the experts are telling us now And whatever they tell us is that pending vaccine or drug we can slow down the spread of the virus while building controlled group immunity have to explain that Those who have had the virus are usually immune afterwards Just like in the old days with measles The larger the group that is immune the less likely the virus is to jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health With group immunity you build as it were protective wall around them That is the principle But we must realize that it can take months or even longer to build group immunity and during that time we need to shield people at greater risk as much as possible Overall there are three possible scenarios The first scenario is maximally checking the virus This leads to controlled distribution among groups that are least at risk That is the scenario of our choice Maximum control means that we try to use measures to smooth out the peak in the number of infections and spread it over longer period With this approach in which most people will only get minor complaints we build immunity and ensure that healthcare can handle it With the aim that the nursing homes home care hospitals and especially intensive care units are not overloaded So that there is always sufficient capacity to help the people who are most vulnerable The second scenario is that we let the virus run unchecked This would completely overload our healthcare system at the peak of contamination leaving insufficient capacity to help frail elderly and other high risk patients We must of course prevent that at all costs The third scenario is that we endlessly try to stop the virus That means that the country is completely locked Such rigorous approach may seem attractive at first sight but experts point out that it certainly wouldn be matter of days or weeks In that scenario we would actually have to shut down our country for year or even longer with all its consequences And if it were practically possible to let people leave their homes with permission only for so long then the virus could immediately re emerge if the measures were withdrawn The Netherlands is an open country and as long as there is no vaccine the coronavirus will continue to spread through the world like wave and not skip our country All advice so far all measures previously announced are aimed at the first scenario of maximum control From the relatively simple guidelines not to shake hands wash hands more often and keep meter and half away from far reaching measures such as prohibiting larger meetings and closing the catering industry And of course we keep our finger on the pulse every day How long the measures are needed and whether more is needed therefore depends on how the virus will behave in the coming weeks and months And of any new scientific insights because the research is ongoing It may be that some measures can be relaxed but that we sometimes have to take an extra step to prevent the virus from spreading unrestrainedly It will continue to fit and measure in the coming months It continues to search for the balance between taking the necessary measures and allowing ordinary life to continue as much as possible If we can control the spread of the virus in this way the public health consequences are ultimately the most manageable At the same time we cannot and will not close our eyes to the economic consequences of this crisis Many people are concerned about their jobs Because for many companies large and small this is an extremely difficult period lot of entrepreneurs suddenly have their backs against the wall The lady of the coffee shop on the corner the flower grower the transport operator the freelancer but it also applies to national icons such as KLM My message to the entrepreneurs of the Netherlands and their employees is this the cabinet will do what it takes to support you We are committed to ensuring that businesses do not fall over by what is happening now and that people are not losing their jobs Either way it will be difficult time but we will not let you down Finally would like to thank everyone in the Netherlands for the way in which the directions and measures have been followed so far and for all the heartwarming examples of mutual aid and solidarity It is good to see that we are ready for each other when the need is man Keep doing that Stay alert and follow the directions even if you are strong and healthy for the benefit of people who are more vulnerable That is really important Continue to use your common sense and listen to the experts Continue to help each other where possible This is time when we need to find each other over disagreements and contradictions time to put the common interest above self interest And time to give space and confidence to all those people who work in hectic conditions day and night to help others and keep the virus under control Cleaners nurses and doctors in hospitals and elderly care general practitioners and GGD employees police officers ambulance personnel and all other care providers To them and to all those people who stay in their jobs in schools childcare public transport supermarkets and anywhere else want to say you are doing fantastic job thank you very much for that would like to end with this appeal with all the uncertainties out there one thing is absolutely clear the task we are facing is very big and we really have to do this with million people Together we will overcome this difficult period Pay little attention to each other count on you Thank you ,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

fghj1x8,If this is the PRC Chernobyl moment then it not like the CCP would be overthrown immediately after the crisis is contained and the Corona Virus burns itself out That not what happened in the Soviet Union Rather this would be moment of truth for the Communist system in which its internal contradictions its moral corruption is laid bare for all to see The Chinese people even Party members and PLA officers would see that this is just crappy oppressive system out of step with the needs of modern country and their own aspirations There might be group of hardliners who try to seize power if they don like the pace or direction of reform but they would fail as the people rally to the reformists But to complete the analogy you need Boris Yeltsin figure who could rally people to his side Someone who is probably not widely known figure in the CCP now but is tied to whatever faction is the most pro reform You need Gorbachev someone who is as pro reform as you could get away with and still be in the Politburo tapped as the successor to Xi as the hardliners lose influence Xi himself would be Breznev type The Gorbachev figure could get the ball rolling but because of his ties to the Party not be the credible figure who could complete the task He get deposed by the hardliners and the Yeltsin analogue would rally people against that coup and the coup would then fail only for the Gorbachev analogue to lose out to the Yelstin analogue The Yelstin analogue would then hammer the final nail into the coffin of the PRC and the CCP taking the decisive steps toward legalizing competing parties and democratic decision making Now don get me wrong If the CCP is doomed doubt it will follow this script with any precision only offer it to suggest one way it could play out to show that it possible ,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

fkdkgiz,so is every person who swears by wholistic medicine Same damn deal If you wanna say trump is killing people then so are the legions of facebook moms that swear by essential oils and other natural remedies Talk to medical professional preferrably someone who did virus work pre It was never question of if pandemic was happening it was when pandemic was happening But everybody laugfhed at them The entire approach of the CDC and the WHO is litterally okay we can not prevent pandemic from happening but maybe just maybe if we get close to the source we can buy the rest some more time and get the samples out that are needed Fuck political whores fuck hot take sluts what matters here is to get the doctors in best not to talk about stuff at all let them be apolitical for time just yto get this virus shit under controll This is why every country has men and women sitting in homes living normal liives but in their closet they have ready packed suitcase and an office cellphone and when they have service they are expected to grab that suitcase on demand kiss their loved ones goodbye and then go to lord knows where put up station and start the work And people looked at all of this and they laughed and went why should we invest more this is just crazy pandemic prepper talk You have enough money lets focus on what is actually imporytant And as soon as what they said would happen happens it the same people who used to ridicule them that are not mercilessly breeaking the legs of every mommy blogger who threatens to come close to them but instead encouraging them Imagine just for second when the virus first appeared people would have been dispatched to every news organisation gottenb the people who wrote about this taken thenm out on the parking lot and then put gun in their mouths You know the kind of treatment they do in the american extermination camps like guantanamo bay Forget the idea of how illegal and brutal this would have been and think of how easy it would have been for the WHO and the CDC toi send their trained nerds out to china you know we are doctors we could give fuck about politics we come from different backgrounds all care about is that pay filthy fucking hipsters fresh out of medschool to sit on their asses and grow fat without having any real experience under their belt You know Han in fact you would be doing me personal favor if you took them in just beat them oif you feel they are not pulling their weight or slacking give tghem any old broomcloset you have to spare or if you are swamped for space and in need of laugh tell them to use the tents but yea they are highly trained but no ammount of training can make up for on the ground experience So know how we doctors get paid allways too little but have my fingers in the pockets of uncle sam you have your fingers in the pockets ofg uncle wu lets forget politics and just work together and worry about the freaks in poilitics when we have this thing under controll If neccessary take everyone from your team to disney land after this shit blows over my treat and will BCC you how many loops have to jump through to get this billed as business expense what do you say Imagine how easy it would have been to convince china to let bygones be bygones and just accept some help Because in the beginning even the chinese were stumped They were ripe for help BUt after they got relentlessly attacked could they admit it without destabilizing their own country Because you know it would be easier if we led the senators that try to sneak shit into coronavirus bills out on the white house lawns and blow their heads off just couple of executions of people like palosi or so that try to politicise the corvid pandemic Just leading them out in shackles having them kneel down on the flag having them read off what they did and then having shotgun blast to the temple would REALLY speed things up Would definitively liberate the country to do what needs to be done right BUt then you would rightfully point out that the situation is little bit more complicated then this that even with an accomplished senator and speaker of the house being shot on national TV this would only strengthen the divisions and the assholes in politics that exist everywhere would be emboldened to be even bigger assholes and at the end the ripples this would create would make the problem worse not better And the same would be true about china where people would very precisely go see this is the problem when you criticise the chairman nobody on regional level can talk to you for fear of reprisals This is why it is so god damn important that the really important shit like CDC who business happens apart from politics That those guys and gals are able to react independantly and while we are still squabbling over stupid shit they can do what needs to be done That even when two nations hate each other maybe we can find doctor from canada doctor from indonesia and doctor from finnland to make this work because at the end the politics mean little when survival is at stake And at certain level the panic kills more people then the actual virus It creates more problems by people that are actually decent and smart but are just afraid Think of the people who saw the newsreports of people buying lot of toiletpaper and went well better get me some as well This is while understandable typically anglo american In germany merkel went before the press and went yep of you will get the virus This would have been unthinkable in america because the press would have destroyed her But the germans when faced with this all reacted the same way Rationally we went okay it ojkay to have fear it good to have fear and be carefull and fuck even bvought some extra toilet paper But we realised that if we would now widely panick we would destropy what little we still had And universally in german society you slowly see backlash of proportions to any hottake that tries to add fuel to the fire any self proclaimed reporter that tries to be more crass gets roasted and germany as whole understands at certain point you have to accept that you will most likely get sick And with all the precautions you can take with everything catrefull as can be even then there is real chance you will get sick What matters now is that if you are in the majority that will weather this you shouldn take ressources away from people that actuially need them Don do things that endanger the people who actually need help just because you are frustrated angry or plain old scared If you need to wait for the next person that tries to sell you some shit that does not have anything to do with coronavirus and mercilessly release all your anger on them Because the doctors nurses and medical professionals they are saints They wouldn hurt fly if they could prevent it The state can But if some asshat writes an other hot take on why the corona virus means the world is now imploding and he walks out and finds out that three of his tires have been sliced open congrats you made him pay for the panic that he helped spread ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

country ROME Italy on Monday became the first European country to announce severe nationwide limits on travel as the government struggled to stem the spread of coronavirus outbreak that has hobbled the economy threatened to overwhelm public health care and killed more people than anywhere outside China The measures announced in prime time news conference by the country prime minister Giuseppe Conte sought to adopt the kind of drastic limits that may be working to control the virus in China an authoritarian regime But the scope of the clampdown in Italy applied to roughly million people from islands in the south to the Alps in the north immediately raised the question of whether an entire modern European nation protective of its individual freedoms would make the necessary sacrifices The broader restrictions came just hours after the authorities announced that people had been infected by the virus more than the day before Deaths climbed to people the majority of whom are overwhelmingly elderly and sick people There were more deaths since Sunday As of Tuesday permission would be necessary for Italians who sought to move around the country for reasons of work health or extenuating circumstances The same criteria would be applied for Italians looking to leave the country but Mr Conte suggested that foreigners could still come to Italy More concretely he said that schools and universities would remain closed as result until at least April Decrees banned jail visits and day release programs for inmates setting off riots across the country at prisons Guards were held hostage and several inmates died in Modena ImagePrime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the new restrictions in prime time news conference on Monday prime minister announces https static nyt com

The days of young people gathering at outdoor events and pubs were over he said We all have to renounce something for the good of Italy said Mr Conte announcing that the government would enact stronger more stringent rules than had been introduced just over day earlier to the country wealthy north He said the classifications between levels of threat in different regions and provinces would be replaced by blanket restriction on nonessential movement across the country that he called Italy protected zone As he attempted to rally Italians to abide by the measures Mr Conte emphasized that the outbreak Europe worst presented an existential threat to the country elderly population the Continent oldest and to the health care system that served them Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter The sudden expansion of travel restrictions reflected the government effort to catch up to the spread of virus that has consistently outpaced its efforts to contain it After the virus first appeared more than two weeks ago the government first locked down towns but deaths and cases continued to spike Early Sunday it announced that it would restrict the movement of about quarter of Italy population locking down the region of Lombardy and risking its northern economic heart for the health of the entire country and the survival of an overwhelmed health

undercut the government assertions of control and authority Different regions had enforced different measures politicians offered different definitions of what movement meant and internet rumors spread unsubstantiated and the authorities said false accounts of overburdened hospitals denying care to anyone over Riots broke out in prisons with guards held hostage and several inmates dying in

or should do to protect themselves We are hearing too many things and people don really get what going on said Laurence Paretti who window shopped in Milan where she taught yoga She said she assumed it was fine to take walk around the city but said that the government explanations aren clear at all Mr Conte acknowledged that change was necessary on Monday night as he introduced what he called stronger and broader restrictions We have to do it immediately he said Giovanni Rezza director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute called the decision necessary and suggested that European neighbors such as France and Germany should follow suit He said Italy was essentially faced with two choices Wuhan style lockdown in which people could not leave their towns including in the economic capital of Milan or the option the government took imposing partial travel restrictions and social distancing by closing bars and sporting events and thus keeping people away from one another Mr Rezza who on Monday morning raised the alarm of the virus hitting Rome said he believed the government feared an epidemic in the less developed south There is huge scare that the

fjc9vy7,While China has been guilty of reporting false numbers many times in the past not everything China reports is false The WHO has largely corroborated China data as they joint published the report The truth is that nearly every country is under reporting their numbers pretty much The major issue at hand is the level of control being exercised by various governments For example China is totalitarian government that can easy exercise travel bans within their country and force citizens to stay put inside their homes Not to mention that China has already devoted state resources on building hospitals within weeks might add dedicated to the virus and is providing testing to their citizens free of charge since they are state run nation Democratic nations cannot do this as easily Japan is great example of this which is why many fear that Japan has far more infected than reported compared to somewhere like China America is similar in the sense that no quarantines have been imposed and the lack of readily available healthcare due to cost to Americans the lack of testing kits available and the cost of testing kits makes it tough for America to get accurate numbers as well So it likely that American numbers are unreported as well An example of Democratic country that took an aggressive approach is Korea which has already increased their capacity for testing provided testing free of charge stockpiled large amount of test kits and is disinfecting areas that infected people have been found in This is why Korean numbers seem so high for example because they have been testing aggressively We will likely see numbers go up as testing numbers increase The latest test numbers show this South Korea Tested Found Confirmed Cases Italy Tested Found Confirmed Cases UK Tested Found Confirmed Cases USA Tested As of March st the CDC has removed the of tested from their website Found Confirmed Cases Source https www worldometers info coronavirus covid testing https www worldometers info coronavirus covid testing ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
fkrni6k,Chinas information war Is failing again Once again China is waging its infamous public opinion warfare against the rest of the world Beijing foreign ministry spokesman tweeted in English last Thursday that It might be S army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan Be transparent Make public your data S owe us an explanation Naturally this infuriated the Americans The S Department of State promptly reacted The assistant secretary for East Asia and the Pacific summoned the Chinese ambassador to Washington The United States strongly protested Beijing reference to the S army and its attempt to deflect criticism that China had started global pandemic by not telling the truth Anonymous S officials reportedly stated Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous and We won tolerate it Of course for most Americans China recent propaganda campaign is unacceptable because as S President Donald Trump said They know where it came from we all know where it came from Many in Tokyo however are not so surprised by China propaganda The Japanese are very much used to Chinese fabrications which have been very frequent over the past few decades experienced this kind of official fake Chinese narrative back in as follows Beijing changed its Japan narrative In May when was diplomat posted in Beijing North Korean defector family of five entered the compound of the Japanese Consulate General in Shenyang China The North Koreans managed to enter the compound but were later forced out by the Chinese police guarding the Japanese mission Unfortunately for China the entire scene was recorded by Japanese NGO Therefore Beijing foreign ministry at first admitted that the Chinese authorities did not obtain Japan consent to enter the compound was sent from Beijing to Shenyang to assist fact finding team that flew in from Tokyo few days later the Chinese foreign ministry suddenly changed its narrative Now it said that the Chinese armed police had entered the compound and arrested the North Korean family with consent from Japanese consul Of course the Japanese side strongly denied that the consul had ever agreed to anything That led me to lose confidence in the Chinese government Chinese diplomats understood that the consulate compound is inviolable under international law They knew the Japanese consul did not give its consent It was unbelievable that those officials could change their narrative overnight China three wars That move was not invented by the Chinese foreign ministry It was part of the three wars concept e public opinion warfare psychological warfare and legal warfare This concept was adopted by the Chinese Communist Party in and was later incorporated into the People Liberation Army Political Work Regulation According to Japan defense white paper public opinion warfare refers to the buildup of morale inside of the country inspiring the army and providing it with fighting spirit while aiming to decrease the morale of the enemy The media and information resources such as newspapers books radio television the internet and electronic mail are all considered operational tools Some commonly used tactics are emphatic blow and information control spreading advantageous information and limiting unfavorable information False narratives must be simple and clear Adolf Hitler once referred to big lie in his book Mein Kampf This has been interpreted to mean If you tell lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it lie about coronavirus S Army origin is big enough What was applicable to Nazi Germany then is now applicable to China False narratives must appear likely China foreign ministry spokesman was not successful in convincing the rest of the world that the S Army brought the epidemic to Wuhan simply because the fabrication is so hard to believe If it were brought by the S Army why doesn Washington have antidotes for infected Americans False narratives must be repeated When asked about the S military conspiracy the spokesman only responded that the international community including the United States has different views on the source of the virus and could not even repeat the disinformation he tried to circulate His S Army conspiracy theory was too improbable to be repeated China information control is not working The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman himself must be wise decent and well educated diplomat and what he said is likely not what he believes It not his fault What wrong is the concept of public opinion warfare itself China version of information control has fundamental defect To spread advantageous information or limit unfavorable information proven facts must be used Information control or public opinion warfare will fail if fabricated information is used especially when the targeted public enjoys democracy and freedom of speech Don underestimate China three wars fighting capability As in the case of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic Beijing information warfare in the international arena may not be as good as it hoped This however doesn mean that the Chinese information warfare is so poor that it can be ignored That Beijing could not successfully deflect criticism in the international community that China had started global pandemic is welcome This however doesn mean that China domestic information control is also poor The government skill to control the flow quantity and quality of information inside the modern Chinese empire should not be underestimated Some people in Tokyo may hope the pandemic will eventually lead to the fall of the People Republic of China This is wishful thinking As long as the Chinese government can tightly control information internally the regime will survive for the foreseeable future

fjgo6jn,I don need uncle intel we have had evidence emerge from medical reports on the virus indicating that it genetically modified material from epidemiologists Not tin foil hatters ve known since January th when virus samples were uploaded outside of China that is when the medical researchers who have to come up with vaccines and treatments went ape shit over what they discovered in the genome India report that got stamped out by the disinformation campaign was accurate this has HIV proteins SARS MERS and Encephlatitis proteins It is made from Bat Coronavirus shell which highly mutates The payload takes person to serious at meaning you have in chances playing Russian roulette with chamber gun that it might take you to serious critical where medical attention is needed or you die With medical treatment becomes despite the lies that the media is claiming at We ve even heard the WHO say to serious and death even with medical treatment and it can be an entire month in hospital until recovered However recovered but not cured is the part most of you are missing in the details The virus likes to mutate just like HIV and change it coronavirus outer sheath This means as the body goes through the normal immune loop to produce an anti body for Generation of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide ie the asymptomatic day day period yes it a bell curve and some people can go potentially longer than days and be infectious without symptoms The virus mutates and new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti bodies and the immune loop process repeats Another click on the chamber gun The body resolves that potentially day process and gets Gen but by that time Gen Gen Gen may now exist the same loop the same click of the gun This is why HIV anti virals appear to be the only working solution for doctors at the moment You catch this and theoretically could need to be on anti virals for the rest of your life just like AIDS patients Part of it genetically modified traits is an entirely new never seen before in nature protein that deals with how it infects the body This is why the rating and chance of being infected is so alarming It airborne it a small microbe microns and just being around someone not showing symptoms can infect via them just breathing Or if they use the toilet as it passes through fecal matter that another person using same bathroom is at high risk of infection so public washrooms should be avoided if there is cluster in your area The bottom line the media is downplaying the severity of this but countries are preparing for it as in judge by what they do not what they say What they say are lies What they do is more important in exposing that lie You don lock down million people in China for the flu What concerns some people who are working on this problem is that the virus although is only to serious because of the mutations it could theoretically be fatal for anyone catching it without medical treatments over time It still too early to confirm that so it a very doomy theory As was told this has the potential to wipe Humanity off the map and can become as common as the common cold now that it part of our viral ecology Add to that you can catch it multiple times it Noval no herd immunity meaning no one is immune You might catch someone Gen Gen Gen infection while you just have Gen causing much more severe chances of going critical and dying if you are around big cluster of infection It was designed to kill that is its job It is weapon Not designed to give you hug and kisses The reason why people are not alarmed China is covering up the deaths burning bodies en mass and lying Iran had leak that over are now dead as of yesterday and that number no doubt is higher today Once you present symptoms and you body recovers the encephalitis portion of the protein sequence is attacking the nervous system where it hard for blood to access and present antibodies the nervous system infection is what is causing people who appear fine to suddenly drop into seizure and die That kick effect is pretty much sudden death as death can happen within minute of that event Assuming pneumonia and hypoxia depleted oxygen doesn kill you event or organ failure ie heart attack liver failure etc event if it in your nervous system event will It a multi tiered killer lots of regions of the body this is affecting Lungs Organs Nervous system Death can come from all three regions of infection and depending on the person this is also part of that bell curve so it seems about days average after symptoms to go into critical but can be longer everyone is different and this also has gain of function meaning it gets nastier as it adapts to you and can become even more lethal not dropping traits but gaining traits as it evolves unlike natural virus that can have loss of function ie become harmless like the cold That is why this is real doom folks not fake doom or fake news It doesn care what you believe if had bunker right now d be in one but don But many CEOs seem to be bugging out It the masses who don know but trust me lots of people in power know what this is However the ministry of propaganda is controlling information ie the infodemic that the WHO talks about saying to them it scarier than the virus but the reality is it will expose the agenda or event reality

fjyws51,TORONTO About day after Chinese researchers published genetic information on the new coronavirus in mid January Toronto laboratory ran its first diagnostic test on suspected case The result was negative By early March Canada with population the size of California had completed close to coronavirus tests The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meanwhile had run less than Although S testing expanded last week local officials have complained that they still can keep up with surging demand Doctors and public health experts say Canada more aggressive approach to testing during crucial early phase of the epidemic could make difference in the way the outbreak plays out in North America Although the number of those tested in Canada is still relatively small on global scale early detection of cases allows for an individual steps to be retraced and contacts to be isolated more quickly limiting the potential for further spread Canada more functional more aggressive approach to testing has undoubtedly put us in better position compared with the S said David Fisman an epidemiology professor at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health To be sure Dr Fisman and others said that won necessarily prevent the virus from spreading widely in Canada something health officials have warned is likely to occur But it could give the country critical edge in the fight against the virus by buying health care workers and governments more time to prepare longer delay could also reduce the overlap of the epidemic with the annual influenza season easing the burden on hospitals Several health experts said Canada learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS which killed people in the country and sickened many health care workers Canadian government reports on the SARS outbreak identified multiple problems including lack of information sharing between different levels of government inadequate distribution of personal protective equipment to front line workers and slow laboratory testing Coordination between different levels of government has improved since that outbreak health experts said and provincial laboratories have developed greater expertise and testing capacity think Canada like Singapore has the legacy of SARS and so takes testing seriously said William Hanage an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University How Coronavirus Test Kits Work YOU MAY ALSO LIKE UP NEXT How Coronavirus Test Kits Work How Coronavirus Test Kits Work Test kits have been one of the main ways to determine if patient has the coronavirus but results from throat swab tests can be inaccurate WSJ visited lab in Singapore to see how the kits work and find out why there are questions over accuracy Photo Crystal Tai Dr Hanage said the K and Israel are also aggressively testing and tracking new cases of the virus which has likely slowed the spread in those countries He said Israel has run roughly tests out of population of about nine million with testing positive according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University The K has tested more than people and identified about cases of the virus according to government tally South Korea the hardest hit country outside of China has the capacity to run as many as tests day and has so far tested more than people Dr Hanage added he expects the number of tests and cases in the S to rise sharply By Sunday afternoon Canada had identified at least cases and the S had according to Johns Hopkins University The S death toll had grown to at least and Canada still hadn reported any deaths Epidemiologists say the S was caught flat footed in the early weeks of the outbreak Until early February the CDC was running all coronavirus testing at its Atlanta headquarters saying it wanted to ensure quality control Then test kit sent by the agency to state and local laboratories was revealed to be faulty further delaying the rollout of tests to the local level The CDC also initially hewed to strict criteria on which patients could qualify for test That criteria was expanded in late February after hospital in California said testing was delayed for woman who had symptoms but hadn recently traveled to an affected area The woman eventually tested positive and became the state first case of suspected community transmission Canada more functional more aggressive approach to testing has undoubtedly put us in better position compared with the S David Fisman an epidemiology professor Canada by contrast took more open approach to coronavirus testing Provincial labs were allowed to begin testing immediately after genetic information on the virus became available on Jan and some hospitals are now developing the capacity to do the same Processing the tests at the provincial level means they can be turned around much more quickly said Vanessa Allen chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario in Toronto Practically speaking that can mean less time in isolation at hospital for those who test negative and faster tracing of past contacts in cases that test positive Laboratories have also been open to accepting samples that fall outside the normal criteria for testing such as for people without recent travel history to places hit hard by the virus We have always said that if clinician has concern about somebody and they have symptoms that could be Covid that we would allow that testing to happen said Bonnie Henry the top public health official in the western coastal province of British Columbia That willingness to test beyond the usual criteria allowed doctor in British Columbia to detect one of the first cases of coronavirus in person who had traveled in Iran before it was widely understood that the virus was circulating in that country On Saturday Dr Henry said the province was experiencing its first coronavirus outbreak after worker and two residents at nursing home in North Vancouver tested positive for the virus The worker illness was picked up through community surveillance program that had recently added coronavirus testing to standard tests to detect influenza in sick patients

fkzs78z,Translation of article With the new coronavirus infection Covid showing signs of being long term issue the government is asking mask producers to convert up to of production to KF standard instead of the KF roughly equivalent to that was previously produced but industry response is unenthusiastic The government rationale for switching to KF which requires less raw materials is to benefit from an increase in the number of masks and also switch the mask rations to KF but the production rate is equal for both KF and KF masks Furthermore it difficult for filter manufacturers to switch immediately production to KF and as the government had been strictly imposing that KF has no infectious agent protection companies are confused by the government capriciousness amp B During briefing on the th the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety FDS reported that in order to convert production from KF to KF work is being started on facility conversion purchase of raw materials etc We anticipate visible results starting the following week For confirmation FDS sent letter to manufacturers last week entitled lt Emergency Health Mask KF Production Conversion Cooperation and Plan Submission Request gt stating each manufacturer must consult with their MB filter manufacturers and order KF filters We need to prepare thoroughly for converting to KF production so reorder packaging as well The core material of the KF certified health mask is the MB melt blown filter Manufacturing filter for KF uses less core material than for KF FDS judged that using less of this core material could increase mask production by up to Mask makers who heard the news pointed out that the government has until now always emphasized that KF cannot provide infectious agent protection and changing the rationed masks to KF right now is going against their previous claims amp B FDS has so far approved the KF grade under the reason of protecting the respiratory system from harmful substances such as yellow dust and fine dust The official position of the FDS was that it had no protection against infectious agents such as viruses On the other hand KF grade was approved as protecting the respiratory system from harmful substances such as yellow dust fine dust or infectious agents and masks could be called prevention masks from KF grade and above For this reason FDS had been punishing manufacturers for over advertising if they included the phrase protection from infectious agents while selling KF masks amp B mask industry worker said It self conflicting for the FDS to strictly monitor the mask quarantine ability standards and suddenly lower it now With study results showing that the Covid virus survives for more than hours in the form of an aerosol it inconceivable why they want to reduce KF production and convert to KF It like they re obsessed with mask supply statistics Another mask industry worker said If the government wants to change the KF for the purpose of preventing only droplet spread it would be better to print health masks padded with waterproof non woven fabric Then they can be sold on the market for KRW around cents amp B There have been remarks that the government was ignorant of the mask production industry situation in the process of requesting this KF KF conversion mask industry worker said that Production speeds of KF and KF masks are equal Maybe the filter production speed will slightly increase but mask production will have the same output He pointed out Telling producers who are hard at work making KF masks to stop operations and convert to KF is nonsense Market demand is utterly tilted towards KF and converting to KF will be giving up competitiveness in the market also complained that There hundreds of millions of KF packaging ve ordered but the government is just ordering us to do what you can Every day the people from the Ministry of Food Drug Police and Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy are monitoring us like criminals Similarly said Report to the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Energy report to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety there are too many reports to make We must manage our production in the remaining time would think that if we report to the FDS the report should be shared between ministries but instead they tell us to report to each individual ministry while following each ministry specific report format Grumbles are rising in the filter industry as well source in the filter industry said Filters don fall under FDS jurisdiction and it was unpleasant to listen to them order us to change to KF as if we had to follow their orders All manufacturers are focusing on producing KF masks but it difficult to comply with orders to print KF filters that we don even know are going to be used amp B In response to fact check call from our newspaper an official from the FDS said We meant that overall production could increase for the mid to long term not that the daily production would increase Creating gain is not short term goal There must have been misunderstanding in communication Regarding the government own reduction of the mask protection standards set by law the FDS official said Even experts judge that the KF standard is sufficient for prevention The KF also has some prevention effects it just that we don test for it He then added As we obviously cannot leave KF effects and functions standards as is we are discussing ways to reflect the current situation implying possible reduction in standards TL DR Gov tried to reduce mask production standards to drive up production numbers Masks take the same time to manufacture regardless of prevention grade Gov is now saying error in communication says that they weren trying to drive up daily production only total production over long term period ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fjjm93u,What Pregnant Women Should Know About Coronavirus The risks so far seem no greater than for anyone else but the research is thin and only applies to later stage of pregnancy By Apoorva Mandavilli Published March Updated March Pregnant women are often particularly susceptible to respiratory infections and once infected can become seriously ill with long lasting consequences for both mother and baby Is that true for the new coronavirus The information available so far is thin but it appears that pregnant women are no more likely than anyone else to have severe symptoms from the coronavirus In an analysis of women only percent had severe disease and percent were in critical condition according to report published Friday by the World Health Organization It is too soon to know the consequences for these women babies But so far at least infants born to women with an infection seemed free of the virus and appeared healthy at birth according to study of nine pregnant women and their babies published last month in The Lancet Fortunately there was no evidence of vertical transmission from mother to child said Dr Wei Zhang an epidemiologist at Northwestern University and one of the Lancet study authors But as Dr Zhang himself noted the study is small And it does not offer any clues to the infection effect on women in earlier stages of pregnancy Fevers in early pregnancy are associated with birth defects and with some developmental conditions And some viruses can have devastating consequences for the fetus Zika for example can lead to an unusually small head and Ebola can be lethal The and flu pandemics had death rates of between and percent among pregnant women The trend in pregnant women infected with SARS the closest relative of the new coronavirus is no more reassuring In one small study of pregnant women in Hong Kong who developed SARS during the outbreak three died and four of the seven women who were in their first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage The WHO statistics for the new coronavirus and Dr Zhang study both offer reason for optimism but data from bigger numbers is crucial experts said We do know that we re going to have lots of pregnant women with coronavirus just given the number of cases said Dr Denise Jamieson chair of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University It going to be critical that surveillance systems collect information on pregnancy status Dr Jamieson is one of three experts who crafted the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for treating pregnant women infected with the coronavirus Among other best practices the guidelines ask doctors offices to screen pregnant women even before their appointment so that women with symptoms can wait in separate area from other patients and to take detailed travel history For their part pregnant women should take the same precautions as everyone else but let their doctors know immediately if they are experiencing any symptoms Dr Jamieson said Pregnant women might also want to obtain copies of their health records in advance so that if there is some disruption in services they have record of their prenatal care she said Dr Jamieson was at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time of the N pandemic About one in three pregnant women infected with that virus were hospitalized The D recommended then that pregnant women who gave birth be separated from their infants until they were no longer infectious The women were also encouraged to continue to express their breast milk but then discard it until they were illness free Dr Jamieson said Similar measures may be necessary with the coronavirus she said Separating moms and babies is obviously difficult issue The infected mothers in Dr Zhang Lancet study were isolated from their infants All nine women gave birth by cesarean section to minimize the newborns exposure to the virus Dr Zhang collaborators in Wuhan the epicenter of the epidemic tested cord blood throat swabs from the infants breast milk and amniotic fluid We did not see any evidence for the virus Dr Zhang said In other reports of infected babies including study of newborns with serious complications the infants were either tested hours after they were born or may have had direct contact with the infected mothers because the women were not diagnosed before delivery Dr Zhang said If we have proper isolation and strict protocol there should be good chance to have healthy baby he said Dr Zhang was careful to emphasize that his study offers good news only to women in late pregnancy We should be very careful not to mislead other group of pregnant women he said We don know the real effect of the virus on women in early pregnancy If women in earlier stages of pregnancy do turn out to be at risk they will be prime candidates for vaccine The first trial for vaccine is expected to begin later this month but its criteria exclude pregnant women Their exclusion is appropriate for this stage of vaccine development said Dr Ruth Karron vaccinologist at Johns Hopkins University and one of the co leaders of the PREVENT guidance for including pregnant women in clinical trials For vaccine to be offered to pregnant women scientists must first balance the risks and benefits in this case she said both are unknown The researchers would need to know the nature and prevalence of the disease in pregnant women as well as any potentially dangerous side effects from the vaccine such as fever But as researchers learn more researchers should plan to include pregnant women in later iterations of the trial Dr Karron said This first trial is just that it a first trial ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fl6arrj,It hasn been perfect but India has done reasonably good job on most counts airport screening quarantining public awareness and even contact tracing in most places Yet it is feared that the community transmission of coronavirus could be upon us mass explosion of cases that India is not well equipped to handle Let us hope that does not happen But if it does the main cause will be want of testing facilities And we don know why India has been so slow in scaling up testing facilities Was it lack of resources complacency or an effort to artificially keep the number of positive COVID cases low Perhaps it was all of these The Indian Council for Medical Research ICMR says it has found no positive case of coronavirus in randomly collected samples of respiratory disease patients in ICUs That sort of thing is hardly justification to not test people with symptoms friend of mine who thinks he has coronavirus symptoms called government helpline all day and after finally getting through was told to reach Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital At the hospital dozens of people including him were refused test because they had no travel history or immediate known contact with anyone who had travel history to severely affected countries But what if even one of these has coronavirus She or he could be spreading it and not taking adequate precaution thinking that he can have the virus since the government doesn even feel the need to find out Also read One coronavirus patient infects people in India much lower than in China Italy Study Why mass testing is key to containing This is the sort of mistake that every country which is now witnessing mass explosion of cases has made The reason Turkey has had only two coronavirus related deaths so far despite sharing border with Iran is because it has been proactive with testing The reason the United States is seeing an exponential rise in the number of cases is that it didn take testing seriously Curiously India banned travellers from Turkey but not the US Countries and regions that have so far been able to contain mitigate or delay the spread of coronavirus have all done so by scaling up testing These include South Korea Taiwan Singapore Japan and Hong Kong Of course they were also ready with the infrastructure to deal with those who tested positive such as quarantining them and protecting health workers and doctors Early and mass testing makes all the difference because in many cases coronavirus can be asymptomatic Put simply the virus may have entered your body but you do not show any symptoms at all Unaware that you have coronavirus you go around spreading it making the vulnerable such as frail and elderly people very sick South Korea mass testing has proved that young people are getting coronavirus in large numbers but showing mild or no symptoms By identifying and isolating such people countries like South Korea have been able to contain the spread of the virus and keep their mortality rates low The importance of testing to isolate asymptomatic patients has now also been established through mass experiment in Italy The residents of the small town of Vo were tested twice all of them Those carrying the virus were isolated By doing so the spread was stopped The number of new cases as result is zero India is refusing to test those with symptoms South Korea is testing even those with no symptoms Short of vaccination mass testing is the best we can do and we can do it through mass testing It is like race between humanity and virus Humanity is far behind and we can play catch up only through testing The silver bullet vaccination is more than year away No data no problem So why is India not testing more people Looks like it is not about capacity According to the Associated Press India has the capacity of testing samples day and yet it is testing only day as of March This is most strange for country that has already seen three deaths Such lethargy in testing may be taken as sign that the Narendra Modi government does not expect coronavirus to reach the stage of community transmission But it clearly does reach that stage The Ministry of Home Affairs MHA mostly busy with the implementation of draconian citizenship laws went back on its promise of giving compensation of Rs lakh for every coronavirus related death This suggests that the government fears mass outbreak Why then is it so reluctant to prevent mass outbreak by mass testing The Modi government has ordered million test kits from Germany and the ICMR has been slowly expanding testing These measures were taken this week They should have been taken latest by February when it became clear that the epidemic was spreading worldwide or at most by March first week when it became clear that coronavirus was not going to be limited to one or two cases in Kerala Sadly the Modi government has lost crucial time The effort to contain or mitigate coronavirus pandemic in India will not look like the efforts taken in South Korea Singapore Taiwan or Turkey In the United States President Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for being behind the curve on testing The US media has investigated the reasons for it In India the media is an arm of the Modi government and the opposition doesn exist Perhaps the Modi government thinks it can overcome coronavirus by fudging or hiding data and what better way to do so by not testing people After all the Modi government hides farmer suicide data consumer spending data or simply stops using the word drought to pretend it doesn happen anymore If denial is the strategy we are in for rude shock very soon Narendra Modi may want to wait for few weeks before trying to look like global leader at the forefront in the fight against coronavirus ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

ffmgh1o,Copy pasted In recent days in the largest quarantine effort in history Wuhan city in China was put on lockdown and the Chinese government imposed wide ranging restrictions on both domestic and foreign travel The actions are aimed at containing brand new coronavirus called nCoV which as of Saturday had killed at least people and sickened nearly in China But the quarantine effectiveness is far from certain Local transmission may be reduced but the virus has already spread beyond China with cases as far afield as Thailand South Korea Vietnam Japan and the United States And even if the quarantine is effective it doesn address the far bigger issue How do we stop this from happening again The emergence of this new virus was predictable even inevitable To understand why requires looking back to an earlier virus that emerged in China SARS Like the new illness SARS was caused by coronavirus In it exploded out of wet market in Guangdon where civet cats raccoon dogs and multitudes of other animals were caged together in tight squalid conditions It appears the new virus has similar origins The initial victims were all connected to huge wholesale market in Wuhan where thousand stalls housed untold numbers of live animals kept in crowded filthy conditions Such wet markets are widespread in China providing newly affluent upper class with status enhancing exotic animals to serve at dinner Some people also believe that eating wild animals has health benefits The problem with the markets is that the unsanitary and tightly packed conditions in which the animals are held create perfect environments for the evolution of viruses that can jump from one species to another The Chinese government shut down wet markets after the SARS outbreak but that ban was short lived With SARS the virus came initially from bats and then was passed apparently to civet cats and eventually to humans Initial indications point to the new coronavirus too having come from bats but it isn yet known how it made its way to humans Coronaviruses have proven themselves masters at jumping from one species to another and how they affect each species can differ greatly An infection hardly noticeable in wild animal perhaps civet cat may spread easily to the next cage whether that cage houses more civets or another mammalian species With coronaviruses the jump from species to species appears to happen fairly easily ADVERTISEMENT The massive poultry farms of Asia which may house as many as million chickens present different but also potentially lethal source of human infection There viruses such as influenza become highly adapted and in crowded circumstances ever more deadly to chickens as there is no cost to the virus if it lethal the next host is only beak away These virulent avian influenzas can and have killed people But humans have to catch them directly from the birds Because they have become so precisely adapted to chickens the viruses have little potential for human to human transmission The same evolutionary process can occur on massive pig farms and can be even more dangerous to people since people are more like pigs than like chickens The deadly swine flu pandemic sprang out of one such massive pig farm in Veracruz Mexico where hundreds of pigs died in an outbreak that eventually moved into people Caging different wild beasts together by the hundreds or thousands as in wet market can produce particularly dangerous environment for infectious diseases like coronaviruses Not only is there an array of possible host species but large numbers of humans are brought into close contact with the animals too With SARS as well as the new coronavirus it appears that the virus jumped first to the people working with these animals in the market and then began another process of evolution which allowed it to spread from human to human adapting to its new host species and becoming more effective at that adaptation all the time As result of such evolution we get brand new human diseases like nCoV which did not exist only months ago It too early to know what kind of threat the present virus poses What important is that we finally learn the right lesson If we want to forestall the evolution of ever newer and possibly deadlier human adapted viruses live animal markets must be permanently shut down Until the Chinese government outlaws these markets until factory farms housing millions of animals are eliminated until we take the inevitable logic of disease evolution into account novel and potentially deadly human diseases will continue to arise Again And again And again,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fl58y3e,Oh man You guys still don understand Listen when the FEDs inject money into stock market the value of the entire market goes up and each stock holder has an increase in his portfolio value the trick is you gotta be the first to cash out And these big guys they have millions of stocks while mid grade and low end traders have like maybe thousands or couple thousand stocks so when the FED injected the money that peak was generated and when you see the peak starting to turn downward is when bots make their first major volume sellouts crashing the market by at least wait couple of minutes till everyone is debating weather to hold or sell see what happens and if enough people hold crash it more to at least of the price thats when the bottom part of the market starts to freak out because many people think trillion dollars is lot it has to keep climbing so they hold in desparation because they think they will get something out of it in the meantime the mid grade trades who realize it will crash begin to sell out their stocks so they at least save what can be saved until the whole thing crashes and is kept there artificially because no money is being pumped back into the system till everyone at the bottom starts getting desperate because many of these are small time regular folk investors who just wanted to try their luck without realizing they are trying their luck with the most rigged system ever made to extract wealth from humanity So when everything crashes these guys come in and buy the desperate sellouts that try to recoup at least some of their losses so they can pay for their real life things that come up and mid grade traders are just happy they didnt lose it all and try their luck some more So yea those trillion That became private profit for the first bunch of movers that managed to sell out They literally printed money out of thin air turned it into private profit and now when the entire market crashes in next months they will fucking BUY ALL OF IT the feds announced trillion dollar injection every day for the entire next month Thats trillion dollar profits that these fuckers will use to buy out the collapsed avio industry and god

The PEF covers six viruses that are most likely to cause pandemic These include new Orthomyxoviruses new influenza pandemic virus Coronaviridae SARS MERS Filoviridae Ebola Marburg and other zoonotic diseases Crimean Congo Rift Valley Lassa fever Its not about money man Its about control Money is the means to control because its irrelevant if the money loses value they don care They don care even if they lose money because people do not understand how conglomeration of power works and how exactly the system is designed to extract wealth from the countries using Central Bank models Don you ever think these fuckers are losing anything the entire fucking playing field is rigged in their favor Besides each country has shit invested into these pandemic bonds and if this shit turns out into pandemic every country will lose their shit because they will owe these bonds to the bank its like when you go to bank and the dude working there is trying to sell you their shitty services like other cards and shit thats how its when minister of finance goes to meet these central bank guys except he can say shit because he cannot do his job he is just face performing function of system thats been predetermined for him he just signes the papers and is grateful in awe to be near such successful and rich cocksucking bankers and asks no questions but believes their expertise because there are the super wealthy and succesful professionals why would anyone doubt them and that they have your best interest in heart lol As for death rate https www bloomberg com news articles of those who died from virus had other illness italy says https www bloomberg com news articles of those who died from virus had other illness italy says More than of Italy coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions according to study by the country national health authority The Rome based institute has examined medical records of about of the country coronavirus fatalities finding that just three victims or of the total had no previous pathology Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about fourth had either one or two previous conditions More than had high blood pressure about had diabetes and third suffered from heart disease Threat to the Elderly The median age of the infected is but most of those who die are older Source ISS Italy National Health institute March sample The average age of those who ve died from the virus in Italy is As of March people under had died from the disease All of Italy victims under have been males with serious existing medical conditions While data released Tuesday point to slowdown in the increase of cases with rise separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real number of cases by testing only patients presenting symptoms The disease has taken the greatest toll on Italy elderly population Figures released Thursday by the Health Institute of Italy indicated that of fatalities were among those aged over People aged to made up further of the deaths But yea no health service in the world would be prepared for this meanwhile the richest people made over billion dollars in profits last year bet you could prepare every health service in the world for that type of money to be prepared for this The problem is this piece of shit capitalist system that everyone praises as the most best and fairest way to redestribute wealth among population is not what its sold as because capitalism has been dead since the This neo capitalist bullshit they keep under table until its time to demolish the whole system and make our lives so miserable and hard that we will be begging for Experts to come and save us by constructing system worth living for us And they will but it won be worth it the totalitarian technocracy of resource based economy will be the final nail in the coffin after that there is no turning back We will be begging to have this piece of shit capitalist junk system back but by then it will be too late Money is not the endgame here its means to an end because with money they can just make everyone do their job to get paid and ask no more questions because thats how the system works man fuckthesystem,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
ffv4r0n,Again as EngineeringNeverEnds has said what you quoted does not say the virus is airborne In fact the only two instances of the word air in the article are the following gt Implications of all the available evidence gt gt Although this novel coronavirus might have first originated from animals and now jumped into humans the possibility of person to person transmission could not be excluded as seen in this family cluster with no known history of exposure to markets or animals and rapid intercity spread might be possible by air travel Vigilant epidemiological control in the community and health care facilities is important to prevent another SARS like epidemic and gt Discussion gt gt We report here familial cluster of unexplained pneumonia due to nCoV Six of seven family members had radiological changes of viral pneumonia among whom five patients and tested positive for nCoV by RT PCR Five patients patients and had associated symptoms at the time of presentation Complete genome sequences of the two strains from patients and showed almost complete nucleotide identity with each other and were closest to the bat SARS related coronaviruses reported in Several possible scenarios of transmission exist The first and most likely scenario is that one virologically documented patient with pneumonia patient acquired the infection from Wuhan hospital while visiting their relative relative and then patients transmitted the virus to patient on returning to Shenzhen The second scenario is that patients have directly acquired the infection from relatives and transmitted it to patient on returning to Shenzhen But this scenario is less likely because patients developed symptoms before relatives The third scenario is that patients acquired the infection from an unknown common source in Wuhan and transmitted it to patient when back in Shenzhen For the patients relatives relatives they could have acquired the infection from the hospital or the community although no virological confirmation was possible and they had no animal contacts game food or visits to the Huanan seafood wholesale market Notably patient or patient who had visited Wuhan hospital might have been infectious before symptom onset because patient was shedding virus without symptoms These findings suggested that person to person transmission and intercity spread of nCoV by air travel are possible supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions Neither of them say the virus is airborne both when read in sentence and read in context of the whole article or even paragraph Air travel refers to airplanes It even clearer in your quote as it immediately follows with supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions Finally the article summarizes your same quote again at the end gt Our study showed that person to person transmission in family homes or hospital and intercity spread of this novel coronavirus are possible and therefore vigilant control measures are warranted at this early stage of the epidemic gt gt Contributors gt gt Now having said all that there may or may not have been report article from other medical experts in the mainland HKU or HK in general that think that saw talking about airborne only remember for sure that droplet transmission was mentioned in few You can go try and find this article But please don use this sentence as proof of the virus being airborne That sentence doesn even talk about what you re claiming ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
fj54zeq, gt love how offended you get when suggest you should go to conspiracy https www reddit com conspiracy would if werent banned And saying something is conspiracy is just saying its fake Which is annoying gt yet you re also critical of the Chinese government for arresting people who break quarantines and for introducing additional lab control measures Theyre arresting whistleblowers and people who spread misleading info Not just those who break quarantine Im not critical of their lab safety but them improving lab safety AFTER an outbreak Am crazy or are people being willfully ignorant to deny what is so clearly in front of them You aren alone but as usual im at loss to find why people would dismiss this information gt but at the same time active cases in China are now falling and it looks like they ve pretty much stopped it as much as they can on their end pending any further outbreaks through the quarantine Because its so bad they stopped updating the numbers and changed positive diagnosis criteria gt If the Chinese government is lying in big way then the same has to be true for officials in pretty much every other country with cases iran and egypt come to mind Look at the official numbers and tell me if it adds up China is communist party and has very good reason to lie Of course they do Even Trump and Pence are lying about this We should always be skeptical of states china especially amp B gt But suggestions that the outbreak originated from lab rather than the usual animal pathway for this sort of thing are based purely on the circumstantial evidence that the only BSL lab in mainland China there been one in Taiwan for decades and for reference there are in the USA happens to be miles away from the epicentre in the same region with no tangible link beyond that coincidence Circumstances like an outbreak originating in the city with the BSL lab Quite the coincidence And ive read reports of mishandling of animals being sold to the animal market in wuhan What was the first theory again Someone got it from an animal market Thats pretty random gt or explanation of how it leaked and ignoring the fact that leaks from BSL lab are pretty unlikely given the controls you need to put in place to actually be certified to BSL Is china known for its top of the line safety protocols guess not if they need to update after an outbreak occurs No explanation of how it leaked you say Not true gt Medical staff and experts have long been asking for better regulation and supervision of biological research institutes in China but with mixed results gt gt top academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering earned million yuan million by illegally selling off lab animals and experimental milk according to report in the Shanghai based The Paper gt gt Li Ning leading expert at transgenic technologies at China Agricultural University was sentenced to years in prison on January for grafting million yuan https www globaltimes cn content shtml https www globaltimes cn content shtml amp B gt There zero actual tangible evidence it was studying this strain of the virus It was almost certainly studying other coronavirus strands of which there are many but conspiracy theories aside this virus wasn discovered or known to the world until after the outbreak Maybe idk gt Claims that it was are pure speculation and to use them as the basis of any sort of argument is bollocks Bollocks only if you want to stick your head in the sand and ignore the circumstantial evidence pointing in one direction amp B gt pushing that directive as evidence or the government admitting that the virus originally leaked from lab is perfect example of people either not understanding the fundamentals of what going on but making articles anywhere or they do understand but they don care because they rather sensationalise the story for pageviews instead Im honestly clueless how smart people still think this outbreak is completely random Will you only accept when the chinese gov comes out and says ya our bad That won happen And the Chinese Gov is monitoring internet comments to control the narrative because of course they are amp B gt But that fine Don worry about the possibility that maybe you ve got few things misunderstood or joined dots that don really exist Its currently literally the most plausible explanation Why would you take the side of lying china gt or that maybe people with deadlines to meet and living to make writing articles might care more about crafting story or exploiting human curiosity than the actual truth The globaltimes is chinese website The other article is the WHO warning an outbreak could happen again from lab misuse You meanwhile dismiss everything as conspiracy because reasons gt from people who also have no specialist knowledge and dubiously sourced reports Nypost Globaltimes WHO And NYTimes Thats my dubiously sourced reports Keep your head in the sand and once again im sure this outbreak is

fl3x03r,Post viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults accounting for up to cases of anosmia Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post infectious loss and over different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for cases It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients There is already good evidence from South Korea China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID infection have developed anosmia hyposmia In Germany it is reported that more than in confirmed cases have anosmia In South Korea where testing has been more widespread of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases In addition there have been rapidly growing number of reports of significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing high incidence of cases Iran has reported sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia and many colleagues from the US France and Northern Italy have the same experience have personally seen four patients this week all under and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia usually see roughly no more than one month think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID Unfortunately these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self isolation While there is chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID has attracted in the media and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains it could potentially be used as screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients who could then be better instructed on self isolation Given the potential for COVID to present with anosmia and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology such as nasal polyps There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self isolate for seven days in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors not realising the need to self isolate It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers Yours sincerely Prof Claire Hopkins BMBCh MA FRCS ORLHNS DM Oxon President of the British Rhinological Society Professor of Rhinology King College London Consultant ENT Surgeon Guy and St Thomas Hospitals Prof Nirmal Kumar President of ENT UK,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
fjn0yj6, Why the Coronavirus Could Threaten the S Economy Even More Than China By Austan Goolsbee March m ET If people stop traveling and going to the dentist the gym or even March Madness basketball games the impact could be enormous an economist says After string of deaths some heart stopping plunges in the stock market and an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve there is reason to be concerned about the ultimate economic impact of the coronavirus in the United States The first place to look for answers is China where the virus has spread most widely The news has been grim with deaths rolling quarantines and the economy seeming to flat line though the number of new cases has begun to fall Advanced economies like the United States are hardly immune to these effects To the contrary broad outbreak of the disease in them could be even worse for their economies than in China That is because face to face service industries the kind of businesses that go into tailspin when fearful people withdraw from one another tend to dominate economies in high income countries more than they do in China If people stay home from school stop traveling and don go to sporting events the gym or the dentist the economic consequence would be worse In sense this is the economic equivalent of the virus varied health effects Just as the disease poses particular threat to older patients it could be especially dangerous for more mature economies This is not to minimize the indiscriminate and widespread damage that the disease has caused by disrupting the global supply chain With shortages of everything from auto parts to generic medicines and production delays in things like iPhones and Diet Coke great deal of pain is coming from the closing of Chinese factories That proliferating damage has central banks and financial analysts talking about global recession in the coming months Nor is it to discount the possibility that the United States will be spared the worst effects Scientific and public health efforts might limit the spread of the virus or quickly find treatment or vaccine The warmer weather of summer might slow the spread of the coronavirus as it usually does with the seasonal flu Many things could prevent an outbreak as large as the one in China But it is to say that an equivalent outbreak in the United States might easily have worse economic impact As baseline several factors work against the United States China authoritarian government can quarantine entire cities or order people off the streets in way that would be hard to imagine in America presumably giving China an advantage in slowing the spread of the disease In addition large share of American workers lack paid sick days and millions lack health care coverage so people may be less likely to stay home or to get proper medical care And percent of China population lives outside urban areas more than twice the share in the United States Diseases generally spread faster in urban areas Beyond those issues however is fundamental difference in economic structure When people pull back from interacting with others because of their fear of disease the things they stop doing will frequently affect much bigger industries in the United States Consider travel The average American takes three flights year the average Chinese person less than half flight And the epidemiological disaster of the Diamond Princess has persuaded many people to hold off on cruises That cruise ship stigma alone potentially affects about percent of the United States which has about million passengers each year compared with only percent of China which has about million passengers People may stop attending American sporting events There have even been calls for the C A to play its March Madness college basketball tournament without an audience But sports is huge business in the United States People spend upward of times as much on sporting events as they do in China And if million Americans stop spending billion year on gyms that would be much bigger deal than if the million gym members in China stopped spending the billion they devote to gyms now That just start Who wants to go to the dentist or the hospital during an outbreak if visit isn necessary Yet health spending is percent of the S economy more than triple the proportion spent in China Of course not every service sector is so much larger than in China Retail and restaurants for example have comparable shares of gross domestic product in both countries But over all the United States is substantially more reliant on services than China is And on the flip side agriculture sector not noted for day to day social interaction and so potentially less harmed by social withdrawal is times larger share of China economy than it is in the United States So for all the talk about the global supply shock set off by the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on supply chains we may have more to fear from an old fashioned demand shock that emerges when everyone simply stays home major coronavirus epidemic in the United States might be like big snowstorm that shuts down most economic activity and social interaction only until the snow is cleared away But the coronavirus could be Snowmaggedon style storm that hits the whole country and lasts for months So go wash your hands for the full seconds And show some more sympathy for the folks quarantined in China and elsewhere Because if it spreads rapidly in the United States it could be heck of lot worse ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fgom845,ManchurianCandidate The hacker known as chan First off if you want more general overview of the simulation and similar pandemic simulations Relik wrote an excellent summary here https www reddit com Wuhan Flu comments ex rrs what learned from pandemic exercises clade I listened to segment which goes over communication protocols and how to control public discourse https youtube com watch LBuP Tko The video is about minutes long and has bunch of government officials and business leaders sitting around table and person in the center saying that certain things are happening and asking each one what they would do It is almost like game of Dungeon and Dragons In the simulation Coronavirus called CAPS which is deadlier than SARS but is able to spread as easily as the Flu from people with mild symptoms in the pathogen early stage eventually kills million people about of global population spreads all around the world and drops global GDP by along with dropping the global stock market There is huge civil unrest civil wars and martial law At they play the epilogue video of how much shit got fucked up listened to this section while on my commute so can timestamp everything Unfortunately when asked hard questions many of the people there gave politician non statements or dodged Lots said things that sound and feel good but don actually mean anything Some things stood out to me however At the beginning they describe conspiracy taking root among the public that pharmaceutical company created the disease to make money off of vaccines One subsection of this conspiracy is that they inject people with the disease through normal flu vaccine then charge lot of money for the vaccine to the new disease People are attacking healthcare workers for being behind this along with minorities and immigrants because the disease came from Brazil The part about healthcare workers isn relevant but the part about minorities is which is why Canada has been saying stuff like racism is more dangerous than the virus because they have large Chinese population At first they strongly encourage social media such as Facebook and Twitter to aggressively remove fake news or fearmongering posts An example would be banning ZeroHedge At they talk about treating social media more like broadcaster than technology discussion platform meaning they could be responsible for what they broadcast and potentially penalized for spreading lies Later on when guy is asked whether individuals should receive legal penalty for spreading fake news he dodges hard Whenever hysteria on social media gets bad enough they do limited internet shutdowns like Iran does during protests because of misinformation being spread on social media They eventually decide this was bad strategy Censoring so aggressively and shutting off the internet inflames panic and brings out thoughts of cover up even more They switch to the flood strategy Instead of shutting down social media discussion they astro turf hard They have shills spam positive and factual information and have the social media grant them special privileges to give them an advantage to broadcast their message An example of this would be Reddit admins handing over Coronavirus to the mods of China Flu who also control epidemic and them stickying heavily moderated askscience thread for the whole website The shills overwhelm the fake news by sheer number with facts making it harder for people to run into misinformation The second part of the flood strategy is to disempower those fearmongering Banning them just proves the truth of cover up Instead they use algorithms against them They make it harder to run into them accidentally by messing with google searches and making them harder to find on social media They also data mine and carefully watch the people fearmongering to gather demographic data and such to better target them ostracize them and hide them from everyone else An example would be the Reddit quarantine If they straight up banned us there would be serious panic and people would flee elsewhere to talk beyond the reach of large corporations They seek to divide and isolate the fearmongerers instead to weaken their reach while still keeping them close enough to control They then talk about using people trust in certain high profile people and institutions to spread the facts They mention how people have large trust in their CEO or bosses and it is better to disseminate information top down by having governments target the CEO of corporations and heads of religious groups and celebrities instead of the common man with fact campaigns letting them then disseminate it to their followers found the part about CEOs really bizarre and they mention it several times about the extraordinary trust people put in their bosses and CEOs so that is who to target Just because work at Home Depot doesn mean give shit what the CEO of Home Depot thinks about the virus This was likely effected by business leaders who have an inflated perception of themselves being present at the simulation table found it somewhat creepy how they were going to take over all these organizations and make them broadcast their message They also mentioned that traditional media such as cable news was given because it is much easier to control than social media They then talk about how the media should be guided once shit gets bad For all their talk about the facts they start encouraging emotional arguments to downplay the disease Stuff like saying mortality is tiny number you ll almost definitely survive or focusing on broadcasting isolated cases like year old with diabetes who had recent heart attack survives the virus to encourage optimism They would play constant news stories of survivors saying It just flu bro type stuff They also talked about how to handle different countries reporting different things about the virus Some are saying it can spread asymptomatically some aren Some are closing their borders some are saying It just flu bro They say that single central organization needs to be risen above all the rest for people to go to for the truth and they all agree it should be the WHO and the UN as people globally look upon the UN as positive and objective force lol editorialized little bit to convey what they were really saying Things like internet shutdowns were after few months of the virus spreading When mentioned them censoring on Facebook aggressively meant as aggressive if not more aggressive than on China Flu Things like the huge army of shills flooding everything were also after few months of the disease ravaging the world Things like the quarantine Zerohedge ban google algorithm changes etc are light measures easily deployed at the very beginning Now know what you are thinking isn spreading facts and preventing misinformation good thing In the simulation with many going anti vaxx and attacking doctors yes The issue is that the disease occurred in China an authoritarian regime that lies lot and doesn allow much foreign rd party observers It is like the Soviet Union trying to cover up Chernobyl If it occured somewhere else maybe there wouldn be so many rumors The WHO is unreliable as we ve seen because it is UN organization which China and its allies have significant sway over due to their wealth and size and China has vested interest in misrepresenting the facts Individual world governments may be more reliable but their response is also based on how much they rely on China Canada has an extremely soft response due to their crucial reliance on Chinese investment and huge Chinese population whereas Trump is taking much harder stance because this gives him leverage in his trade war However he can take too hard stance because recession would affect his re election This kind of thinking applies to all world government responses you will see This simulation had the people there take all sorts of extreme measures to stop the disease and it still caused massive damage This was realistic simulation to show how badly the world could get messed up by such virus unless they took certain large preventive measures to improve their infrastructure to fight global pandemics Unfortunately this simulation happened just few months ago so such measures were never implemented think we can look at the simulation as very viable representation of our potential reality ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

fk9vfl0,OP please post your paywall article text below Edit Business The first S layoffs from the coronavirus are here Job losses have begun in ports bakeries and travel agencies Economists worry more layoffs are coming as businesses see plummeting sales Sam Creighton at her home in Los Angeles Due to the coronavirus business has fallen and Creighton was laid off after nearly three years at company that helps travelers get visas to China Philip Cheung For The Washington Post By Abha Bhattarai Heather Long and Rachel Siegel March at m EDT The coronavirus outbreak is taking deep toll on the S economy prompting hundreds of layoffs over the past week alone and halting historic year bull market in stocks Strong job growth and soaring financial markets have fueled the S economic expansion over the past decade Now the rapid market decline and initial layoffs are heightening fears that the longest economic expansion in S history could come to sudden end just month after unemployment stood at half century low The Dow Jones industrial average lost points or percent Wednesday with every sector slumping after the World Health Organization designated the coronavirus pandemic The Dow closed in bear market territory meaning it had shed more than percent from its high less than month ago Airlines hotels travel agencies and event companies have all been suffering but interviews with more than two dozen firms and workers reveal that the pain is now translating into layoffs in wider circle of industries including bakery and chain restaurant At the Port of Los Angeles drivers have been laid off and others have been sent home without pay as massive ships from China stopped arriving and work dried up At travel agencies in Atlanta and Los Angeles several workers lost their jobs as bookings evaporated Christie Lites stage lighting company in Orlando laid off more than of its workers nationwide this past week and likely will lay off more according to chief executive Huntly Christie Meanwhile hotel in Seattle is closing an entire department former employee said and as many as people lost their jobs after the South by Southwest festival in Austin got canceled Economists fear more layoffs in the coming weeks as supply chains come to halt and people stay home and spend less We will definitely see an effect on jobs from the coronavirus and it could be pretty large in leisure and hospitality said Julia Pollak labor economist at ZipRecruiter The first thing we ll see is reduction in hours We hear many reports of employers canceling staff everywhere except in health care Monday in Los Angeles Sam Creighton and about colleagues were fired from the China Visa Service Center Creighton helped Americans get travel documents to China but business plummeted as groups and individuals canceled trips to Asia out of virus fear The company processed around visas month in February that number fell to The visa center did not return request for comment This job was my paycheck said Creighton who worked at the company for about three years really don know what to do next Baiden King lost her job at Carson Cookie Fix bakery in Omaha on Tuesday because online sales and customer traffic dried up dramatically especially after the state first case of covid was reported nearby The company didn return request for comment King said her manager told her when she showed up for her shift that morning she had no choice King made an hour If my job laying off people can only imagine other employers are as well said King who is preparing to move back in with her parents m not sure anyone will be hiring These early coronavirus related jobs cuts appear to have mostly affected younger entry level employees and gig workers Workers receiving pink slips said they have no idea whether these layoffs will be permanent and that it is nearly impossible to look for another job right now with many companies instituting hiring freezes Uncertainty is high and as people lose jobs or fear losing jobs they typically scale back spending even more which has ripple effect on local economies For example the Port of Los Angeles the busiest port in the United States has become ghost town four workers said They said the port has never been this quiet not even during the Great Recession The ongoing lack of cargo prompted Shippers Transport Express to send layoff notices at the end of February to drivers who transport containers from the port to corporate warehouse hubs The company told workers there is near shutdown of its operations at the port for the foreseeable future Many factories closed in China stunting shipments to the United States Chinese factories are struggling to reopen after the coronavirus ve been working the ports for years and ve never seen anything like this said Randy Williams trucker for Shippers Transport Express m glad didn buy house yet He said the port typically handles over containers night at his part of the operation including some Walmart products but is down to He didn work at all last week and it been spotty this week Williams has dipped into his savings and money is tight with son in college But he has union benefits and is applying for unemployment insurance He also saved from years of an hour pay Not everyone at the port has that situation Josue Alvarez drives for another company operating at the port XPO

fkafh1n,I think that is gross misunderstanding of the situation to simplify Biden voters would be happy with Biden They would be happy with Bernie Bernie voters would be happy with Bernie They would not be happy with Biden Again Grossly simplified Here why Bernie is out there Visibly Talking about their points and speaking passionately Biden is not Apparently Biden is being kept away from the public due to the several times they have made mistake Bernie is progressive with very up to date or out there social values Biden whether he has those values or not is not out there vocally What this means is Bernie is motivator Biden is not This is why Bernie has the young vote The energetic vote The online vote Bernie voters are very worried about the planet Student Debt Medicare To name few Biden doesn care about that Bernie supporters are very passionate about these things m sure Biden voters would like these things maybe they don The keywords here are passion energy motivation So when you say Everyone that saying they won vote for Biden is hypocrite that expected me to vote for their guy They don expect you to vote for your guy Bernie They expect you to vote in your own best interest In lot of cases voting for Biden is not in your best interest Medicare for all Corona Virus anyone Coming back to those keywords Biden supporter wants Team Democrat to win They aren talking values or what the platform is Motivating Biden supporter to vote blue is easy However for Bernie supporter Biden is just slightly less worse than Trump You want people to go to the polls and vote blue no matter what then you have to give them more of reason than Because Trump That a threat You are threatening people to vote for you and then calling people hypocrites for failure to understand something beyond your own understanding of Team Red Team Blue In todays current climate It feels like this is the last chance we ll get at perhaps correcting the planet And it only chance The US really needed to lead the world globally on climate change ages ago It taken Donald Trump to try and get this Wake Up chance Donald Trump happened because of severe lack of motivation energy in leadership In relation to the above It seems large chunk of the democratic population want Bernie It not like he is losing by lot and you still have to remember that lot is stacked against Bernie Media plays big part In you got Donald Trump because people didn want to vote Status Quo Corperate Democratic Party Hillary People didn vote as middle finger up to the Democratic party Start putting in proper people that represent us So you think the Democratic party might wake up and start representing the people better However Along comes Biden You put Biden up there and that a middle finger up to what people wanted in but didn get So in you maybe get Biden Then in your option is back to non progressive policies which screw over people slightly less than the Republicans do Like the spongebob meme How many times do we have to each you this lesson old man So the population might still be trying to get the democratic platform to change by not letting the Democrats win Start representing us better Of course the massive downside right now is that the Republicans being in power for another years leads to some severe stacked long term positions which could spiral into Republican domination for years to come as they play even dirtier ,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

fklk0tn,With the marked increase in Covid cases announced on Thursday and our first indication from the National Public Health Emergency Team of ICU bed usage by patients with the novel coronavirus many challenges lie ahead Doctors here are likely to face some very difficult decisions involving triage and the rationing of resources Rationing is defined as the allocation of healthcare resources in the face of limited availability which means that beneficial interventions are withheld from some patients Triage is the process of deciding who gets treatment priority it is used in war zones by medics to decide which wounded soldiers will be transported to hospital first Less dramatically triage is used to decide who gets priority in overcrowded emergency departments We can learn lot from the Italians They are about two weeks ahead of us in the pandemic process They have the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Europe and as result have seen unprecedented demand for intensive and critical care facilities This week the Italian College of Anaesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care described how some hospitals in Northern Italy are so overwhelmed that they simply cannot treat every patient They have had to engage in wartime triage Noting the difficult choices that have faced doctors and nurses the College said it is matter of giving priority to those with the highest hope of life and survival In context of grave shortage of medical resources the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care their document states Starkly the specialist group says it may be necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care This is not value judgment but way to provide extremely scarce resources to those who have the highest likelihood of survival and could enjoy the largest number of life years saved In addition to age the presence of comorbidities needs to be carefully evaluated It is conceivable that what might be relatively short treatment course in healthier people could be longer and more resource consuming in the case of older or more fragile patients Ireland intensive care unit high dependency unit bed capacity is one of the lowest in Europe We have beds per million people Italy has beds per million If northern Italy has run out of intensive care facilities and we get the same surge in very ill coronavirus patients as it has then some very difficult challenges lie ahead For us to avoid an epidemic peak that overwhelms the health system we must flatten the curve of transmission The Government decision on Thursday to introduce measures in order to increase social distancing is an attempt to do just that As the European Centre for Disease Control has advised measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission and reinforcing healthcare systems The other side of managing what lies ahead is to increase our intensive care capacity One major teaching hospital here has doubled its number of ventilators in the last few days These breathing machines are vital in managing coronavirus patients who develop severe pneumonia Sources have praised the HSE for short circuiting the equipment purchase process to enable emergency funding to be spent rapidly And having medical device manufacturing capacity in Ireland has also helped they say But you cannot build new units in the short time we have available What is being done is the realignment of ICUs here to increase the number of beds in each Plans are also in place to convert operating theatres into temporary ICU capacity Doctors and nurses who are not specialists in critical care medicine are being formed into teams led by experienced intensivists to meet the surge Unless we are extraordinarily lucky however frontline health professionals are likely to face considerable dilemmas and challenges For example how to decide in an ethically appropriate way to remove one patient from ventilator so another person can use it Or which of two patients should be admitted to the last ICU bed It will be important to explain and communicate to the patient and their relatives why they have reached ceiling of care and won be offered that bed The absolute best way for us to spare patients and healthcare workers such traumatic decisions is to embrace with vigour and good humour the social distancing measures that have got underway ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

afternoon acting in the best interest of the health and safety of our students staff families and community our Board of Education at the recommendation of our superintendent Dr Kelly Bowers voted unanimously to dismiss schools beginning Monday March through Friday April We expect to resume in class learning at our schools on Tuesday April following our regularly scheduled Spring Break April We understand that our community depends on schools to educate our students as well as to provide important and necessary services We considered this fact carefully and due to the unprecedented health crisis gripping our area state and country made the decision to dismiss schools in an effort to slow the spread of COVID Public health officials expect COVID cases to rise over the next few weeks and we believe school dismissal in combination with actions by other local government agencies will help to slow the spread of this virus Our Child Nutrition Services Department will offer all children aged and younger free meal pick up service at East Avenue Middle School East Ave Junction Avenue School Junction Avenue and Marylin Avenue Elementary School Marylin Avenue We will offer delivery from the inside center of the drop off loop from m Monday Friday March April Each child will receive breakfast and lunch In order to contain the spread of COVID we strongly recommend that students stay home and minimize social contact as much as possible to keep caregivers and adult family members safe Children congregating in groups and or in close proximity could effectively nullify any community benefit from school dismissal Children have not been shown to be high risk group for serious illness from this virus however they can transmit the virus to those most vulnerable Public health officials recommend that families make arrangements for childcare during closure that avoid leaving children with elderly people who are more vulnerable to the impact of the virus During school dismissal we will be offering flexible learning opportunities that can be accessed from home We will send an email to all families next week with more information We have kept our schools open as long as possible as recommended by state and local public health authorities We know that in addition to education schools provide vital support to our communities and that closure will have major impact on our families Making the decision to dismiss schools is the result of serious consideration We believe this is necessary step to mitigate the pandemic Thank you to our entire community for your

fldbomg,Shitty small businesses That is who is most impacted here Since you losers don read anything being actually proposed Phase stimulus The CARES Act Objective Provide up to trillion in assistance to distressed sectors of the economy and direct payments to S families The package is expected to include approximately billion to the airline industry billion to other industries such as hotels cruise line operators shopping mall operators etc billion in payments to individuals likely to be paid in two phases April and May and billion in small business loans Status The numbers referenced above are constantly changing and the language of the bill remains highly fluid Republicans have failed to get enough support to pass the legislation in two separate votes March Several sticking points remain for Democrats regarding the corporations receiving federal assistance including stock buybacks and executive pay as well as unemployment insurance and worker protections Sen Rubio plan On March Sen Rubio unveiled the Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act which is component of the proposed Phase stimulus package that provides billion in small business loans Objective Prevent workers from losing their jobs and small businesses from going under due to economic losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic Assistance would be conditional upon businesses retaining their employees and payroll levels during the covered period March through June and would Provide cash flow assistance through percent federally guaranteed loans to employers who maintain their payroll during this emergency If employers maintain their payroll the loans would be forgiven Expand the allowable uses for loans to permit payroll support including paid sick leave supply chain disruptions employee salaries mortgage payments and other debt obligations to provide immediate access to capital for small businesses Provide million in grants for SBA Small Business Development Centers and Women Business Centers for counseling training and related services for small business owners Authorize million for SBA to provide grants to associations representing resource partners to establish an online platform that consolidates resources across multiple Federal agencies and training program to educate small business counselors on those resources to ensure counselors are directing small businesses appropriately and Provide million in grants for the Minority Business Development Agency Minority Business Centers to offer small business owners impacted by COVID counseling training and technical assistance Status Currently the plan is part of the negotiations in the Senate involving the Phase stimulus Tweaks may be made based on various small business interest groups that want more immediate relief than they think SBA can provide See Private Public Partnership Proposal below Small Business Administration SBA On March SBA announced the Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL program Objective Offer access to low interest federal disaster loans for working capital to small businesses suffering substantial economic injury as result of COVID The following is summary of program components and processes SBA Office of Disaster Assistance will coordinate with the state Governor to submit the request for EIDL assistance WI MN and IL have submitted requests Once declaration is made for designated areas within state the information on the application process for EIDL assistance will be made available to all affected communities Eligible entities may qualify for loans up to million which may be used to pay fixed debts payroll accounts payable and other bills that cannot be paid because of the disaster impact Loans above require collateral but SBA will not decline loan for lack of collateral It will require borrowers to pledge what is available The interest rate is for small businesses without credit available elsewhere businesses with credit available elsewhere are not eligible The interest rate for non profits is SBA will offer loans with long term repayments to keep payments affordable up to maximum of years Terms are determined on case by case basis based upon each borrower ability to repay Status SBA is currently setting up the framework and accepting requests from states to be part of the program Doubting the SBA will be effective in quickly rolling out the program and providing much needed capital some small business groups are advocating for an alternative program as outlined below Private Public Partnership Proposal Objective Expedite the process of obtaining capital for small businesses through private public partnership Although many federal lawmakers assume SBA is the best vehicle to get small businesses the support they need many small businesses believe that relying on the agency to set up the infrastructure and processes for support will not meet the immediate needs for liquidity for small businesses which will face capital concerns in days not the weeks it would take SBA to implement the program fully Several fintech firms and their trade associations are now lobbying Congress with proposal to provide limited loan guarantees to regulated banking entities for small business loans and lines of credit made through the banks existing conventional lending programs An Associated partner The proposal includes loan guarantee Equal to for loans and lines of credit made that qualify under the bank existing credit policy that was in place as of February and for all other loans and lines of credit extended by the Bank and In effect for period of two years from the date of execution of contract Advocates of the proposal believe the program will be successful because The lending infrastructure is already in place as many of the largest banks in the S have websites open to apply for small business loans or have call centers ready to take applications Capital can be delivered in twenty four hours instead of the typical days or weeks in SBA lending Banks have the capital and liquidity to execute and Built in governance already exists for banks to develop credit policy through risk management committees Status Groups lobbying for the program have put the proposal in front of dozens of congressional offices and meetings have apparently occurred with Sen Rubio Federal Reserve Main Street Lending Program Objective Support lending to eligible small medium sized businesses complementing efforts by SBA Status On March the Fed simply announced that it expects to announce soon the establishment of Main Street Business Lending Program to assist small medium sized businesses Updates will be provided as details are announced ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
fkh9tfo, study by the University of Southampton examining non pharmaceutical interventions NPIs in response to the new coronavirus COVID in China shows that range of early coordinated and targeted measures are needed to help significantly reduce its spread Researchers in the population mapping group WorldPop ran complex modelling using anonymised data on both human movement and illness onset to help simulate different outbreak scenarios for cities in mainland China This allowed them to understand how variations in the timing level and combinations of interventions affect speed and transmission of the disease Findings are available in preprint paper on medRxiv https www medrxiv org content website The study estimates that by the end of February there was total of COVID cases in China It shows that without non pharmaceutical interventions such as early detection isolation of cases travel restrictions and cordon sanitaire the number of infected people would have been times larger than that which actually occurred The research also found that if interventions in the country could have been conducted one week two weeks or three weeks earlier cases could have been reduced by percent percent and percent respectively significantly limiting the geographical spread of the disease However if NPIs were conducted one week two weeks or three weeks later than they were the number of cases may have shown fold fold or fold increase respectively Study author Dr Shengjie Lai https www southampton ac uk geography about staff sl page of the University of Southampton comments Our study demonstrates how important it is for countries which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on number of fronts We also show that China comprehensive response in relatively short period greatly reduced the potential health impact of the outbreak The research also found that improved disease detection isolation of cases and social distancing for example the cancelling of large public events working from home and school closures are likely to have had far greater positive impact on containment than travel restrictions The authors suggest social distancing should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after the lifting of travel restrictions in late February Director of the University of Southampton WorldPop group Professor Andy Tatem https www southampton ac uk geography about staff ajt page says We have narrow window of opportunity globally to respond to this disease and given effective drugs and vaccines are not expected for months we need to be smart about how we target it using non drug related interventions Our findings significantly contribute to an improved understanding of how best to implement measures and tailor them to conditions in different regions of the world We are now focussed on adapting this work to new settings beyond China to support response efforts Different countries may need different approaches but we aim to help them make informed decisions on how best to put interventions in place Population mapping work by WorldPop funded primarily by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is helping to inform the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the potential spread of COVID and provides valuable information about how best to effectively target interventions in countries globally ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fkt83k5, Jamil Anderlini yesterday couple of years ago was walking through small town in rural China when young boy approached me nervously expected him to practice his English but instead he demanded to know why had burnt down the Summer Palace in Beijing Drilled by his teachers on all aspects of the atrocity carried out by British and French troops in he bravely confronted the first person he saw who resembled those barbarian invaders Not long after that was sitting at dinner party in Delhi when slightly inebriated gentleman demanded all British at the table acknowledge Winston Churchill as far worse historical villain than Adolf Hitler Many in the west are barely aware that the world two most populous nations were founded in explicit opposition to western colonialism and imperialism particularly the British variety They are even less conscious of how these narratives have become powerful tools in the construction of sometimes vituperative nationalism It is this that allowed the spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry to claim last week and be believed by many in China that the coronavirus was brought to Wuhan by the US military Today China and India account for almost third of the global economy in purchasing power terms Demographics and development levels almost guarantee their economic and geopolitical power will continue to grow Without clear understanding of historical events that have formed their world views the west will find it increasingly difficult to deal with these nascent superpowers For the People Republic of China modern history officially begins with the first opium war of when Britain defeated the Qing empire and gained the colony of Hong Kong thus launching century of humiliation that only ended with communist victory in Virtually every schoolchild in China and India can recite the treacherous deeds of Lord Palmerston who served twice as prime minister and dominated British foreign policy from to Everyone in Japan knows about the black ships of American Commodore Perry that forcefully opened the country to trade in the But how many British or American students have heard of Perry the battle of Plassey or the Boxer Rebellion How many could explain the differences between the Bengal famine of and the Bengal famine of That second tragedy which killed millions and was exacerbated by British policy is the reason many Indians hate Churchill so much Indian historians quote the feted wartime prime minister blaming the famine on the beastly people of India who had caused the food shortages themselves by breeding like rabbits In Britain America and most of Europe it is exceedingly rare for people to learn about colonial history unless they specialise in it at university For the average British conservative the empire evokes vague feeling of nostalgia For the average liberal it conjures up fuzzy sense of guilt The campaign for Brexit with its slogan take back control was based on an amorphous vision of return to the times when Britannia ruled the waves There were also grand promises of free trade deals with economic powerhouses in the Far East If the average Brit had even cursory understanding of colonial history they would have understood how unrealistic that is With their creation myths built on humiliation at the hands of perfidious Albion it is very unlikely that China or India will ever agree to trade deal with the UK on anything but the most punitive terms It is surprising how few western diplomats are aware of their own countries troubled legacies In addition to including colonial history in the curriculums of western school systems governments should make intensive courses compulsory for foreign service officers am not suggesting the UK and other former colonial powers indulge in self flagellation or ask their citizens to apologise in perpetuity History is always more nuanced than the narratives created by nation states to serve political goals This complexity was summed up by George Orwell in his short essay Shooting an Elephant in which the protagonist white colonial policeman in Burma muses on the brutality of imperialism With one part of my mind thought of the British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny with another part thought that the greatest joy in the world would be to drive bayonet into Buddhist priest guts Only when armed with historical facts and an understanding of this nuance can western diplomats scholars and businesspeople develop the empathy needed to navigate the minefield of historical grievance in former colonies That understanding would also allow them to push back on some of the more corrosive nationalist ideas in places like China and India In some cases this would be service to people in those countries The narrative of victimhood that blames all current problems on historic colonialism too often allows bad leaders to exonerate themselves for their misrule today jamil anderlini ft com,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China asking How can we protect ourselves and our families The epidemic could have been controlled fairly easily three weeks ago had there been more openness swift action and no attempted cover up But now it too late and this virus is spreading globally Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV the Wuhan pneumonia and infection has spread throughout China the government is forced to turn to its SARS playbook And that means entire cities must be cut off and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease spreading behavior It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon know people are very frightened And expect panic will rise in the coming days But very simple measures can protect you During the SARS epidemic traveled all over China and Hong Kong interviewed people infected with the virus doctors and nurses treating the disease government officials police everybody was never concerned that would become infected despite being in the room with sick individuals And that because knew what precautions to take Here are the most important ones to know When you leave your home wear gloves winter mittens or outdoor gloves and keep them on in subways buses and public spaces If you are in social situation where you should remove your gloves perhaps to shake hands or dine do not touch your face or eyes no matter how much something itches Keep your hands away from contact with your face And before you put your gloves back on wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water scrubbing the fingers Put your gloves on Change gloves daily washing them thoroughly and avoid wearing damp gloves Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless it disgusting as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria rarely wear face mask in an epidemic and have been in more than outbreaks Instead stay away from crowds and keep my distance from individual people half meter about feet is good standard If someone is coughing or sneezing ask them to put on mask to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids If they decline step meter about feet away from them or leave Don shake hands or hug people politely beg off saying it better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic Inside your household remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member Wash all towels twice week Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses like common colds flus and yes coronaviruses Be careful with doorknobs If it possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders do so Wear gloves to turn doorknob or wash your hands after touching it If anybody in your home takes sick wash your doorknobs regularly Similarly be cautious with stairway banisters desktops cell phones toys laptops any objects that are hand held As long as you handle only your own personal objects you will be ok but if you need to pick up someone else cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else computer keyboard be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object If you share meals do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils to remove food from serving bowl or plate and of course tell your children to never drink out of anybody else cups or from container of shared fluid It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes Don do this until the epidemic is over Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls return the serving spoon to the main dish and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices Absolutely do not buy slaughter or consume any live animal or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus When the weather allows open your windows at home or work letting your space air out The virus cannot linger in well ventilated space But of course if it is cold or the weather is inclement keep warm and close those windows Finally if you are caring for friend or family member who is running fever always wear tight fitting mask when you are near them and place one on the ailing person unless they are nauseated When you replace an old dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very very careful assume for the sake of your protection that it is covered in viruses and handle it while wearing latex gloves place it inside of disposable container seal it and then put it in the trash While wearing those latex gloves gently wash the patient face with warm soap and water using disposable paper towel or cotton swab and seal it after use in container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash Wear long sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water including sheets towels and utensils If you have space isolate the sick person in your household in room or corner of room where they are comfortable but separated from the rest of the household If the weather is tolerable open window that is on the opposite side of the room so that air gently blows past the patient face and then outdoors Of course don do this if it is very cold as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold The Chinese government will take very drastic actions over the next few weeks and this will be time of hardship for the Chinese people As the virus spreads in other countries similarly draconian measures may be invoked to slow the epidemic But with these simple precautions if taken by everybody in your household building office and school you will dramatically reduce the spread of the virus and bring the outbreak to its knees Be safe Do not panic Take commonsense precautions As frightening as this time is you will get through it ,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

What May Happen More cases of COVID are likely to be identified in the coming days including more cases in the United States It also likely that sustained person to person spread will continue to occur including throughout communities in the United States It likely that at some point widespread transmission of COVID in the United States will occur Widespread transmission of COVID would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time Schools childcare centers and workplaces may experience more absenteeism Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths Other critical infrastructure such as law enforcement emergency medical services and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed At this time there is no vaccine to protect against COVID and no medications approved to treat it Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy https www cdc gov coronavirus ncov summary html You re right there is no cause for concern that the CDC expects widespread transmission in the US since this iS jUsT FlU bRo But since the CDC is lying it a good thing you trust what the WHO says From the situation report on March th https www who int docs default source coronaviruse situation reports sitrep covid pdf sfvrsn ccef How are COVID and influenza viruses different The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses Influenza has shorter median incubation period the time from infection to appearance of symptoms and shorter serial interval the time between successive cases than COVID virus The serial interval for COVID virus is estimated to be days while for influenza virus the serial interval is days This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID Further transmission in the first days of illness or potentially pre symptomatic transmission transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms is major driver of transmission for influenza In contrast while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID virus hours prior to symptom onset at present this does not appear to be major driver of transmission The reproductive number the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual is understood to be between and for COVID virus higher than for influenza However estimates for both COVID and influenza viruses are very context and time specific making direct comparisons more difficult Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community For COVID virus initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the age group are low Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults rather than vice versa While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar the fraction with severe disease appears to be different For COVID data to date suggest that of infections are mild or asymptomatic are severe infection requiring oxygen and are critical infections requiring ventilation These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children pregnant women elderly those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed For COVID our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection Mortality for COVID appears higher than for influenza especially seasonal influenza While the true mortality of COVID will take some time to fully understand the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases is between the infection mortality rate the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections will be lower For seasonal influenza mortality is usually well below However mortality is to large extent determined by access to and quality of health care Bullet points are my notes summarizing the above The flu spreads faster That combined with the fact the flu has many year head start explains how it has so many more infections already this season Reproductive number between and The value for was Twenty four studies reported values for the pandemic The median value for was

tour groups gt The third is maid of one of the women while the fourth is tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop gt The tour group in question has since returned to China gt In addition another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday Feb gt The two were among group of people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on Scoot flight last Thursday Before this another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases gt In total there are now confirmed cases in Singapore gt The new cases constitute limited local transmission the Health Ministry said on Tuesday gt There is however no widespread evidence of widespread community transmission said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at press conference gt It is possible that there could be broader community spread despite our best efforts he told reporters gt Should that happen Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human to human interactions such as cancelling mass gatherings suspending schools and paring down non essential care services to slow the spread of disease gt The country has been preparing for such clusters and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters to the broader community MOH said gt As surveillance has been stepped up more such local clusters are expected including more cases of local transmission it added gt The ministry has also started contact tracing so as to ringfence the cluster and limit further spread gt Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected said Mr Gan who co chairs multi ministry task force to defend the country against the virus gt This is scenario which we are prepared for he said noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation gt As the situation evolves we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore gt With local transmission happening here the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly gt To keep students safe for instance schools will implement staggered recess times and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large scale gatherings gt As an added precaution the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China gt In addition all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the nCoV as the virus is called since last week gt Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often especially high traffic areas gt The earlier confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported comprising Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan the capital of China Hubei province gt One has been discharged said the ministry on Tuesday gt The update was given after two day lull on Sunday and Monday when no new cases were reported gt The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community it must prepare for long fight against the virus Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday gt It was first reported in Wuhan late last year As of Monday it had infected more than people and claimed over lives mainly in China gt Outside mainland China there have been close to cases and two deaths one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines gt Global authorities have warned of more person to person spread with the United States Thailand South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission gt On Tuesday Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to They said the year old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for meeting last month with colleagues from China including one from Wuhan But he showed symptoms only on Jan nearly week after he returned to Malaysia gt Chinese data suggest that the new virus while much more contagious than Sars is significantly less lethal although such numbers can evolve rapidly It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human to human transmission gt Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non essential travel to

fh835ki,Full text Key diagnostic test might be missing many coronavirus cases China ability to control rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic is under further strain amid fears that key test used to confirm new cases is failing to catch large numbers of people with the disease Problems with so called nucleic acid tests NATs widely used to identify the presence of the previously unknown pneumonia causing virus make it likely that many infections are going uncounted even as the number of confirmed cases continues to spiral Authorities are still struggling to ascertain the true extent of the epidemic which had infected link in Chinese people and killed in China as of Friday Feb according to the National Health Commission NHC In Hubei the province at the epicenter of the outbreak reports of overwhelmed hospitals scarce medical supplies and overly stringent diagnostic criteria have complicated efforts to determine the scope of the disease Health officials have recommended cheap abundant and generally accurate NATs as one of main methods to confirm the presence of the coronavirus in humans The technique involves collecting samples from patients and testing them for specific kinds of molecules that appear in the genetic material of the new coronavirus If those molecules are present in the sample the patient is isolated for treatment But there is growing concern that those NATs are producing large numbers of false negatives In Wednesday Feb interview with state broadcaster CCTV Wang Chen an expert in critical diseases and director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said one characteristic of the virus was that not all of those infected by it return positive NATs Even patients who definitely have the disease only come back positive of the time Wang said Testing throat swabs from potentially infected people also returns lot of false negatives Tests like NATs are especially important in people that may have contracted the virus but have not yet shown symptoms Emerging trends in local infections mean that many such patients may have been sent home by hospitals after their NATs came back negative doctors told Caixin At the moment more and more cases in Wuhan are flaring up collectively in family groups and the majority are of the concealed onset type said Zhang Xiaochun deputy director of the medical imaging department at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University one of the institutions at the center of the outbreak They may have undergone one or even several NATs and shown no clinical symptoms but keeping them under observation at home is bound to spread the disease further doctor in the imaging department of another major Wuhan hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity told Caixin said that previously some patients whose CT scans clearly showed signs of viral infection but whose NATs tested negative were released back into their communities due to shortage of hospital berths NATs are by nature an imperfect mechanism for determining the presence of given organism For instance because the genetic material they test for usually only exists in tiny amounts many NATs include step called amplification which makes many copies of it shortcoming of amplification is that it also copies any contaminating DNA in the sample potentially causing misleading results All experienced doctors know that NATs contain flaws the doctor told Caixin Aside from NATs health officials have also recommended the use of gene sequencing to confirm coronavirus infections But that method has its own problems Although gene sequencing is comparatively accurate it is also expensive and not all affected hospitals have the necessary facilities Additionally at the start of the outbreak many hospitals had to gain permission from higher authorities to conduct such tests rule that has since been relaxed Experts have previously called for the inclusion of CT scanning as key basis for diagnosing coronavirus infections as well as rapid hospital admission and isolation In response to calls from medical professionals on the frontlines of the epidemic the NHC on Tuesday Feb relaxed the clinical criteria for reporting suspected coronavirus cases with extra leeway granted to people in Hubei Outside the stricken province medical professionals should now suspect coronavirus infection in patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia fever and or breathing problems and low to normal white blood cell count or low lymphocyte count Within Hubei only of the criteria are required China added more than new coronavirus cases each day from Monday through Friday Feb through Feb with the vast majority occurring in Hubei according to NHC figures ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fkgp81i,Got this being passed around my circle of co workers Somewhat interesting although for most readers lot of the medical jargon may be difficult to pick up This is from front line ICU physician in Seattle hospital This is his personal account we have pts and deaths since we are seeing pts who are young fit no comorbidities critically ill It does happen US has been past containment since January Currently all of ICU is for critically ill COVIDs all of floor medsurg for stable COVIDs and EOL care half of PCU half of ER New resp sx pts Pulmonary Clinic offshoot is open CDC is no longer imposing home quarantine on providers who were wearing only droplet iso PPE when intubating suctioning bronching and in one case doing bloody neurosurgery Expect when it comes to your place you may initially have staff home quarantined Plan for this NOW Consider wearing airborne iso PPE for aerosol generating procedures in ANY pt in whom you suspect COVID just to prevent the mass quarantines we ran out of s thanks Costco hoarders and are bleaching and re using PAPRs which is not the manufacturer recommendation Not surprised on s as we use mostly CAPRs anyway but still terminal cleans inc UV light for ER COVID rooms are taking forever Enviro Services is overwhelmed Bad as pts are stuck coughing in the waiting room Rec planning now for Enviro upstaffing or having plan for sick pts to wait in their cars that is not legal here sadly CLINICAL INFO based on our cases and info from CDC conf call today with other COVID providers in US the Chinese data on mildly ill hospital ill critically ill are generally on the mark Data very skewed by late and very limited testing and the number of our elderly pts going to comfort care being young amp healthy zero medical problems does not rule out becoming vented or dead probably the time course to developing significant lower resp sx is about week or longer which also fits with timing of sick cases we started seeing here after we all assumed it was endemic as of late Jan early Feb based on our hospitalized cases including the not formally diagnosed ones who are obviously COVID it is quite clinically unique about have mild lower resp sx need NC are sicker FM or NRB tubed with ARDS Thus far everyone is seeing nl WBC Almost always lymphopenic occasionally poly predominant but with nl total WBC Doesn change even days in BAL lymphocytic despite blood lymphopenic try not to bronch these pts this data is from pre testing time when we had several idiopathic ARDS cases fevers often high may be intermittent persistently febrile often for gt It isn the dexmed it the SARS low ProCalc may be useful to check initially for later trending if later concern for VAP etc up AST ALT sometimes alk phos Usually in range No fulminant hepatitis Notably in our small sample higher transaminitis at admit correlates with clinical deterioration and progression to ARDS LFTs typically begin to bump in nd week of clinical course mild AKI Cr lt Uncertain if direct viral effect but notably SARS RNA fragments have been identified in liver kidneys heart and blood characteristic CXR always bilateral patchy or reticular infiltrates sometimes perihilar despite nl EF and volume down at presentation At time of presentation may be subtle but always present even in our pts on chronic high dose steroids NO effusions CT is as expected rarely mild mediastinal LAD occ small effusions late in course which might be related to volume status cap leak Note China is CT ing everyone even outpts as primarily diagnostic modality However in US Europe CT is rare since findings are nonspecific would not change management and the ENTIRE scanner and room have to terminal cleaned which is just impossible in busy hospital Also transport in PAPRs Etc of our pts had CTs for idiopathic ARDS in the pre test era they looked like the CTs in the journal articles Not more helpful than CXR when resp failure occurs it is RAPID likely out from sx onset but rapid progression from hospital admit Common scenario for our pts is admit NC Next hrs gt NPPV Next hrs gt vent proned Flolan interestingly despite some needing Flolan the hypoxia is not as refractory as with N Quite different and quite unique Odd enough that you notice and say hmmm thus far many are dying of cardiac arrest rather than inability to ventilate oxygenate given the inevitable rapid progression to ETT once resp decompensation begins we and other hosps including Wuhan are doing early intubation Facemask is fine but if needing HFNC or NPPV just tube them They definitely will need tube anyway amp no point risking the aerosols no MOSF There the mild AST ALT elevation maybe small Cr bump but no florid failure except cardiomyopathy multiple pts here have had nl EF on formal Echo or POCUS at time of admit or in couple of cases EF ish chronically Also nl Tpn from ED Then they get the horrible resp failure sans sepsis or shock Then they turn the corner off Flolan supined vent weaning looking good never any pressor requirement Then over hrs newly cold clamped multiple pressor shock that looks cardiogenic EF or less then either VT gt VF gt dead or PEA gt asystole in less than day Needless to say this is awful for families who had started to have hope We have actually had more asystole than VT other facilities report more VT VF but same time course few days or week after admit around the time they re turning the corner This occurs on med surg pts too one today who is elderly and chronically ill but baseline EF preserved newly hypoTN overnight EF lt Already no escalation has since passed So presumably there is viral CM aspect which presents later in the course of dz of note no WMAs on Echo RV preserved Tpns don bump Could be unrelated but ve never seen anything like it before esp in pt who had been HD stable without sepsis Treatment Remdesivir might work some hosps have seen improvement with it quite rapidly marked improvement in days ARDS trajectory is impressive with it pts improve much more rapidly than expected in usual ARDS Recommended course is but due to scarcity all hosps have stopped it when pt clinically out of the woods none have continued gt It might cause LFT bump but interestingly seem to bump ish for day or after starting then rapidly back to normal suggests not primary toxic hepatitis unfortunately the Gilead compassionate use and trial programs require AST ALT lt normal which is pretty much almost no actual COVID pts Also CrCl gt which is fine CDC is working with Gilead to get LFT reqs changed now that we know this is mild viral hepatitis currently the Gilead trial is wrapping up NIH trial still enrolling some new trial soon to begin can remember where steroids are up in the air In China usual clinical practice for all ARDS is high dose methylpred Thus ALL of their pts have had high dose methylpred Some question whether this practice increases mortality it is likely that it increases seconday VAP HAP China has had high rate of drug resistant GNR HAP VAP and fungal pna in these pts with resulting increases mortality We have seen none even in the earlier pts who were vented for gt before being bronched prior to test availability again it is not great idea to bronch these pts now unclear whether VAP prevention strategies are also different but wouldn think so Hong Kong is currently running an uncontrolled trial of HC IV general consensus here in US among docs who have cared for COVID pts is that steroids will do more harm than good unless needed for other indications many of our pts have COPD on ICS Current consensus at Evergreen after some observation amp some clinical judgment is to stop ICS if able based on known data with other viral pneumonias and increased susceptibility to HAP Thus far pts are tolerating that no major issues with ventilating them that can be managed with vent changes We also have quite few on AE COPD asthma doses of methylpred so will be interesting to see how they do ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fizlbzq,Biologist here ve been scratching my head on this one The method used for testing is called rt RT PCR RealTime Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Normal PCR is method of amplifying DNA mostly to detect something or to perform molecular biology or genetics It roughly doubles the concentration of DNA every cycle of the reaction cycle is one round of temperature cycling to change the confirmation of the DNA and allow the reaction to take place in steps This method can be used on RNA directly because the polymerases used generally cannot amplify RNA Instead Reverse Transcriptase enzyme is used to convert RNA to DNA in the first cycle one step RT PCR or in separate reaction two step RT PCR Once it is converted to DNA it can be amplified just like in standard PCR The Real Time part is because of another modification fluorescent signal released that is proportional to the amount of DNA present This is generally done one of two way using fluorescent dye that lights up when bound to double stranded DNA or using DNA probe that sits on the target DNA and emits light when the protein that is replicating the DNA runs into it The latter is what the CDC is using By measuring the light emitted from the reaction each cycle scientist can tell in Real Time whether or not the sequence they are looking for is there The method is also sometimes called quantitative PCR qPCR because of setup right you can calculate the amount of your target sequence in the sample by calculating how many doubling times it took to become visible Note there are esoteric differences between RT PCR the other RT PCR rt RT PCR and qPCR but they are all pretty much variation on the same principles The CDC kit consists of four sets of of primers to amplify specific sequence and fluorescent probe Three of these target the gene of coronavirus at three separate places The fourth set is for quality control targeting the Human RNAse This control is basically so you know that you are looking at high quality sample from human should have human RNA from the swabs negative and positive control are also suppose to be run with the kit but those aren supplied by the CDC with the kit though the positive control can be obtained from them separately For the test to be considered positive or negative here are the things that have to happen All Positive controls must all be positive and at the expected cycle number amount All Negative controls must show now amplification of DNA RNA For the results to be positive The controls must work as stated above All Three gene reactions must be positive For result to be negative The controls must work as stated above All three gene reactions must be negative The human RNAse gene must be detected before the th cycle e there has to be present at amounts that can be reproducibly detected The only conclusion can come up with is that the CDC is more too focused on the accuracy and or sensitivity of the test Possibly because of the FDA but m not sure think the CDC was the first to raise concerns of high false negative back in early February or late January m assuming that is why they use three primers while other mostly use or and run the test multiple times Supposedly the reason the kits don work is because they can produce inconclusive results don know at what rate So the only thing can imagine going wrong with the test is that one of the probes doesn work The other reagents can be obtained commercially guess it could be the human RNAse probe but there are other quality control probes that labs can get their hands on And you don need that to get positive result just negative one So that just leaves one of the three probes But if that the case why not just go with two until the third is replaced Is the test accuracy that low for two probes Then other country tests probably aren as accurate as they are letting on https www cdc gov coronavirus ncov lab rt pcr detection instructions html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

fk5kz4r,I have theory on the great TP crisis ve read few articles that explain the psychology behind panic buying but haven seen anything that actually isolates why TP is the white ticket item This craze appears to have begun in Australia then herd mentality followed as we began to see low shelf stock pictures were being posted media coverage instigated fear then international coverage on our strange choice of stockpiling sparked world wide trend The same advice is being echoed over and over to try to stem this unusual stockpiling Toilet paper will not protect you from Coronavirus We will not run out of toilet paper This is not why toilet paper is flying off the shelf so this advice is not working Australia has just come off the back of an extreme bushfire season It was traumatic and still very fresh in our mind Many of us evacuated with little in the way of supplies many were evacuated from their evacuation safe zones once or twice perpetually trying to out run this out of control event that was threatening lives and lively hoods It lasted months not days not weeks months Some of us were prepared some of us were not We shared what we could but access was real issue even with so many people working together We are not used to preparing for emergencies we are pretty laid back bunch she ll be right was fortunate despite fires raging to the north south and east of our town was packed and ready but we didn need to leave It was scary though Not feeling in control of our situation set about trying to maintain some semblance of control We discussed escape plans when we would leave who we would check in with We prepared our home filled the cars packed variety of food water med kits smoke masks fire blankets toy boxes clothes important documents sentimental items and toilet roll in each car what was thinking Thousands of people spent long periods either on the run or trapped in dangerous places with little to no access to basic goods toilet roll was not going cut it if we ended up in the same position So coming directly off the back of traumatic period still nursing our wounds and remembering how much control we lost and how we couldn even wipe our scared butts because toilet paper was the one thing we didn think to pack plentiful supply of and we had limited access to even obtain said rolls what do you expect us to do to try to reclaim some sense of control of our butts Stockpile the one thing we all missed while dealing with our crisis Why we are hearing it won protect us from the virus is beyond me this is not why we are stockpiling The fact that we won run out of toilet paper is little more reasonable but again does not address why we are doing it so that advice will not help We are afraid of becoming isolated and that is not being addressed at all We have just been through terrifying isolation and even the most coordinated efforts were not able to bring enough supplies when they were needed How are we going to access food medicine and the coveted toilet paper if we are told to isolate or our towns enter lockdown We don know what isolation looks like for us in the face of pandemic How will supplies be made available to us if our towns are in lockdown Will deliveries of stock still be allowed in Who will even be willing to make that delivery How will supplies be made available to us if we are ordered into home isolation Will online deliveries for anyone with positive test be made priority so we don go week without And what about the casual workers who won have money to buy supplies if they become isolated Will there be package to assist them If our real concerns were addressed rather than floating advice that is as absurd as our panic buying appears to be then maybe we would calm down little because we will feel secure that our country has plan to maintain control after so months we have already faced feeling out of control ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fhzbtrj,ECONOMISTS STILL puzzle over Abenomics the experimental mix of policies introduced by Japan prime minister Abe Shinzo seven years ago in an effort to ward off the country deflation and stagnation But two lessons are clear Japan bond market is remarkably docile And its households are painfully sensitive to increases in the consumption tax broad value added tax imposed on many of their purchases After the government raised the tax from to on October st the economy shrank at an annual pace of in the fourth quarter of according to figures released on February th see chart The tax increase was an unforced error The government faces no immediate need for additional revenue Despite gross debt nearing of GDP its borrowing remains absurdly cheap The yield on ten year government bond is stuck at about zero where the country central bank the Bank of Japan BoJ has pegged it since That peg obliges the BoJ to buy as much government debt as necessary to keep long term interest rates low Such an accommodative stance is needed chiefly because private spending has been weak too weak at least to lift inflation currently at to its target of Thus the consumption tax rise was doubly strange It made it even harder for firms to sell their goods to Japan inhibited consumers so that Japan government could sell fewer bonds to an automatic buyer It was like shifting weight to the waterlogged side of ship The error was foreseeable as well as unforced rise in the same tax in April was followed by similarly dramatic contraction in the economy undermining the early momentum of Mr Abe reflationary push The government had hoped to avoid repeat of that experience by adding various offsetting measures including free education for pre school children and rewards system for customers who paid cashlessly These measures may have softened the blow in some ways consumer spending on non durable goods fell by less last quarter than it did in the episode Unfortunately these offsetting measures were themselves offset by another aggravating factor the impact of Typhoon Hagibis which inundated many towns and killed almost people in October As consequence capital spending by firms shrank even faster than it had after the tax increase six years ago Japan prospects for recovery are threatened further by coronavirus Covid has already killed one person in the country have been infected not counting hundreds diagnosed on cruise ship docked in Yokohama south of Tokyo Japan is tightly integrated into Asian manufacturing supply chains that will be disrupted by factory shutdowns in China It has also been counting on the Tokyo Olympics which start in July to lift spirits and spending That happy prospect must now be in doubt The government has already said that only elite athletes will be allowed to take part in the Tokyo marathon on March st Faced with these fiscal natural and viral setbacks what will the BoJ do Since when it cut the interest rate on some bank reserves to and pegged longer term yields to zero it has seemed largely out of ideas Inflation has persistently undershot its target which would call for easier monetary policy But its negative interest rates are already unpopular with banks insurance companies and savers And they might prove counterproductive if they inflict too much damage on Japan financial institutions which struggle to pass the negative rates on to their own depositors possible solution proposed by Stefan Angrick of Oxford Economics British consultancy would be for the BoJ to pay higher interest rates on some bank reserves to shore up the banks profitability but even lower rates on the remainder to help stimulate borrowing This tiered system helped Switzerland central bank cut interest rates to One twist is that all three of Japan recent disasters the tax increase the typhoon and the virus tend to put upward pressure on prices even as they have depressed demand That nascent inflationary pressure might deter the central bank from easing further even as the economy remains weak Japan might then finally escape its long stagnation but only by entering an unhappier period of stagflation ,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

fk1asf3,The real objective answer is simple We Are Not Ready Why because no one is No Health Care system in the world can handle this and for sure not anymore To handle this we would have to be prepping for months you would not be able to hide it We would know about it For example the USA will be shit show mostly due to Trump and the stupid but usual conservative shortsightedness when it comes to anything to do with science So by the time they try to get hold of this they will be Wuhan After studying the CoronaVirus responses you will see the multitude of vectors and reasons why it got worse in one country and not so much in others Not going to get too much into it since papers could be written on each But just to mention them The basics population density Bad luck for China it happening during the Lunar Year was good and bad Better for us though due to ecomic and supply chains reasons Culture etc We are wealthy country We are fairly strong democracy For contrast Iran is not The level of education in average is fairly high among the populance For contrast India does not We have fairly good government people can bitch all they want but we are no theocracy or have someone incompetent like Trump fucking up government communications by putting politics first Which will put people at ease Perceived or not our government does not have history of blatant corruption so people trust their government far more because of it The WHO released statement praising us for this exact same point on the weekend For Contrast Italy does not They have history of heavy personal corruption and thus the people do not fully trust the government to fully have their best interest at heart Even if they are Culturally we are more about the greater good than the me me me obsession you see in the USA or elsewhere This translates in co operation based on what is best for all of us instead of just because am and because it is in my best interest to help myself This seems small but it is huge difference would say this is one of our best traits and big factor that has helped so far Among how this was handled you will find main approaches Don Test Can Tell science based approach or mixture of both to various degrees The first approach was used by China Iran and USA Just to give examples This happens when governments put the economy or politics first We are using mix of both They are clearly keeping the economy either first or second but they are also trying to track down case histories Keep channels of communication open So people are more likely to want to help All of this adds up to keep the rise manageable Which right now it is VITAL We have kept this outbreak from going full Wuhan on us But believe you me it will get worse But with some luck it won get like the USA so quickly We might even be able to avoid most of the worst of this clusterfuck Biologically speaking There are other factors at play The economy the collapsing supply chains the ethical and legal issues we are starting to see The fact that the virus has already mutated and the fact that we are discovering that it can move onto your nervous system as per some Chinese publications and others am currently following paper that was being peer reviewed that touches on this as possible vector We are still at the beginning here guys This virus has changed the world Don see the virus as the biggest problem There are in fact very serious problems coming all at once which include the virus This is not fearmongering The writting has been on the wall to anyone who knows some biology some economics some statistics and math since early January am far from singular am no one special As far as what we can do Well Canada is opening specialized clinics My guess is to ship people out from economic centres once shit hits the fan and if self isolation becomes not enough which think it is almost guaranteed to happen assume they will open some near those centres So expect some in Ontario looked it up and see they opened one near Guelp also Quebec obviously BC and maybe Alberta As per the individual your role is simple Do not get fucking sick In best case scenario based on scientific based approach our streets should be looking like Wuhan right now because we would be taking proactive approach rather than leaning on the reactive But that would have meant massive economical policy changes that no want to do unless utterly and completly necessary Mathematically speaking the people that die because of this are not statistically significant to warrant those changes It would tank the economy short term but it would save lives and arguably more money down the road but no one outside tiny nations are doing this like the Marshall Islands or Micronesia Hence we are doing mix in order to better ballance the economic hit But don pretend that you are waiting for the virus to explode It is already here Do not go out unless utterly necessary Avoid all public transit if possible Have at least month worth of food buy non perishable Worst case scenario you saved yourself few grocery trips Why month China has extended the period of observation to days from Use gloves and maintain feet distance from everyone outside Develop cleaning protocol for you get home Wash your hands and begin the habit of being aware to not touch your face Do not care about peer preeasure or of what other people think You might not get it bit if you do remember that sure it might be mild but that mild term also included pneumonia It is not fun either way so expect at least minimum week break from your life If not longer Prep for that Actually take the time to educate yourself beyond just news stories They are meant to manipulate you and to calm you down or they may be fear mongering depending on what you watch studied advertising and it is clear as day that they are trying to do that maybe little too much and are giving people false sense of safety and perhaps sense of dread as time goes on It could blow up on them later The WHO is full of it and they are sucking up to China but watching full press interviews from beginning to end will give you lot more info and context than watxhing two weeks worth of CBC selected clips Talk to your family about it What will you so if you or someone esle gets sick Important of you live in family units Familiar clusters can be problem if you did not prep enough We are one cluster and death away from shit getting very real to lot of people The magic number is From observation it is usually about days to double after that Albeit can see the growth in Canada to be slower compared to others unless we find cluster Some people are going to have very hard awakening soon The problem is that people suck at foresight unless it is affecting them directly somehow Remember this is the larger pandemic in years Our best hope to move quickly from this will be once treatment is designed in order to reduce the of the virus until vaccine comes down the pipe am almost flabbergasted at the speed we are working on some but then it bring some of those ethical and legal issues had mentioned It will be challenging few months for many Stay safe

fj3x822,From the article using safari reader mode Updated m Feb With worries about the coronavirus growing globally so too are many questions about the new health threat Here are answers to some key questions from veteran health reporter Felice Freyer https www bostonglobe com staff freyer Article Inline Text Link What does it feel like to have the new coronavirus The illness now known as Covid feels similar to the flu The main symptoms https www cdc gov coronavirus ncov about symptoms html are fever cough and shortness of breath Although this is new virus so far it appears that the illness is mild in percent of those who get it An unknown number of people get infected but have no symptoms at all That doesn sound so bad What the big deal For starters percent do get severely ill and can develop pneumonia Some even need intensive care and mechanical ventilation Covid sufferers could overwhelm hospitals if the epidemic spreads in this country Children https www statnews com coronavirus kids what role transmission don seem to be affected But elderly people and people with chronic illnesses are at high risk So even if you survive Covid outbreak someone you know may not Get Metro Headlines in your inbox The top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily What is the death rate recent study http www cidrap umn edu news perspective study covid patients finds death rate of the Chinese outbreak put the death rate at percent That more than times higher than the death rate from seasonal flu It possible that number will change when it becomes clear how many people have been infected Another study https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa query RP of Covid patients who were hospitalized in China published Friday found that percent of them died In what other ways is Covid different from the flu It more contagious Each person who gets sick with Covid on average infects two or three other people For the flu it closer to one person How does Covid spread Doctors believe that the primary mode of transmission is the same as for the flu or cold When an infected person coughs or sneezes droplets bearing the virus spray into the air and then quickly fall to surfaces below If you re within feet of coughing and sneezing person you could catch it If you touch surface with live virus still on it and then touch your mouth nose or eyes you can become infected It not known how long the virus survives on surfaces But there are other possibilities still under investigation The virus that causes Covid has been found in stool samples so it possible it spreads through feces And researchers have not ruled out the possibility that the virus can become airborne and able to travel through ventilation systems What is the treatment for Covid So far there is none although new collaboration https www bostonglobe com business harvard scientists collaborate with those china million coronavirus effort Article Inline Text Link between Harvard Medical School and Chinese scientists is working on it The National Institutes of Health has begun testing https www nih gov news events news releases nih clinical trial remdesivir treat covid begins an antiviral called remdesivir to see if it can treat Covid But all these efforts take months Meanwhile when people with Covid go to the hospital they get what is called supportive care that is doctors help them breathe and fight off infections until their own immune systems can defeat the virus Why is there no vaccine This virus is entirely new and vaccine development is long process It also takes money and pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to develop vaccines because they re not profitable Still at the urging of the federal government few companies are at work on it Moderna Therapeutics based in Cambridge recently submitted candidate vaccine for early testing But testing takes time To give vaccine to population of healthy people researchers have to be confident that the risk of harm is exceedingly low Vaccine candidates have to be tested in animals and then in people That takes many months How can avoid getting sick You may be tired of hearing it but your best defense really is to wash your hands often when out in public Bring along little bottle of hand sanitizer for backup Put real emphasis on washing often It really works Also avoid touching your face The virus gets into your body through your mouth nose and eyes Dr Paul Biddinger chief of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital said that studies during the outbreak of SARS similar coronavirus found that hand washing and avoiding touching the face decreased the risk of illness by percent to percent Also try to stay away from sick people And if you re sick do your part cough into your sleeve stay home Why not wear mask Because mask won protect you https www bostonglobe com metro do need wear face mask block coronavirus Article Inline Text Link and health care workers need them more urgently Don contribute to the global shortage https www bostonglobe com metro do need wear face mask block coronavirus Article Inline Text Link of masks https time com medical masks coronavirus covid However if you re sick with respiratory illness and you wear mask in place like clinic waiting room you can avoid spreading your illness to others How worried should be There is so much we still don know about this virus and how it will play out if it starts spreading more widely in the United States Right now it not big deal here only cases most in people who had traveled to China recent case involved California woman who had not recently traveled abroad or had contact with someone suffering form Covid Disease trackers are investigating how she might have been infected But her case suggests the virus may be quietly spreading in the community Where it goes from there is anyone guess Perhaps it will affect only certain regions or sicken few people Perhaps it will roar across the country filling hospital wards and morgues Or maybe the result will be something in between For many people the biggest difficulties may not be illness but the disruption of daily life as result of such possible measures as school and business closings event cancellations supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions Should you worry Uncertainty is hard to cope with but worrying can be unproductive better approach might be to plan to think about what you might need to do if things get bad Ask your employer what plans are in place if you can get to work Can you work at home if need be Do you have the equipment needed Fill your prescription medications to ensure you will have some on hand if you need to stay home for couple of weeks If child or elderly person depends on you think

fir6xh2, gt It still leaves doctors open to accusations of murder or at best manslaughter by assisting suicide That a career ending condemnation So physician unjustly performing euthanasia shouldn be convicted of manslaughter or murder You re going to have hard time selling me that gt People who really want to live will exhaust every method available don worry Will every method available be actually available to them Is it now Even with public healthcare not every procedure is available to everyone eligible so yes we have much to improve upon Imagine following scenario patient is in need of critical procedure which would improve their quality of life but it is not performed in their country so to get the procedure done they would have to travel to another country and get it done there They would of course have to pay for the procedure and travel expenses because their home insurance doesn cover said procedure The patient cannot afford such an expense Is it therefore ethical to performe euthanasia on this patient If euthanasia is not performed the patient has the choice to refuse all other treatment or receive palliative care Which do you choose It leaves bad taste in the mouth but such cases do exist gt their choice of treatment or no treatment Dragging things out isn always better than dying No treatment option doesn always mean dragging thing out it means making person comfortable gt That a matter of the legislation of no importance on considering whether it should exist at all or not Research funding goes where there money to be made Look at the amount of articles published on COVID right now Euthanasia will divert funding away from other research looking at improving palliative care and improving quality of life before passing gt don see why it wouldn and that indeed what happens in practice Some doctors would rather not be involved and leave it to others Similarly some doctors don perform abortion For what reason isn important some specialization isn harmful as long as access to all options is preserved m not talking about that m talking about Euthanasia creating new category of patients which will have to be faithfully represented in research Statistics are great way to hide things and this new category will make new challenge to critically evaluate research gt It not choice between different flavors it a choice to not eat at all It more life choice than type of treatment That exactly what said There are clear indications when to administer food and when not to any and all kinds of food gt They do have to explain when the patient asks But there are for example no physicians on the street informing random passers by of their medical options They will respond with options when patient comes to them with problem or desire they won volunteer everything the patient could possible do which is quite lot if you include things like elective surgery like plastic surgery and preventive operations In general the patient comes to the doctor with medical problem to have that problem solved Euthanasia typically only comes into play when all options are exhausted or when the patient is no longer willing to undergo increasingly burdensome treatments with less and less chance of success When patient comes out of the blue asking for euthanasia the norma reflex is to ask to motivate that and if the patient says want euthanasia because have an unbearable itch then the doctor will say but have you tried scratching it and so on typical legal euthanasia process requires formal documentation of these steps m going to attribute this to your unfamiliarity with the medical profession and not to you deliberately misrepresenting what have written gt Lessen suffering is not good enough if you can outright end it The value of life is not infinite Firstly with this end you don just end suffering you end everything And secondly already said that euthanasia can be justified in some cases We re going in circles gt It up to the patient to decide whether they want to bear the burdens of the process Correct gt No he simply executor of the will of the patient He is most definitely not The patient is the executor of his own will He is partner in healthcare offering services Nobody expects that physician will do something patient wants just because they want it That may be in the US where patient can almost always find physician who will do their bidding but it is most certainly not the case here gt There also is absolutely no doubt about what the result of euthanasia will be The physician would role change with such an option not because the end result of euthanasia wouldn be known but because it is Does policeman have the right to you deadly force or does he have to prove the court he had to use it afterwards Only soldier on the battlefield can kill and even then it is possible he may be reprimanded if the kill wasn justified Do you want to give physicians right to kill with basically no oversight am in no way trying to compare the deaths on the battlefield with those of patients but the right to cause death of person is at issue and that is not to be taken lightly gt It quite unempathic to refuse suffering patient their only way out And this is not even addressing the quote ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

emergency plans through that whole government approach gt Educate your public so that people know what the symptoms are and know how to protect themselves and others gt Increase your testing capacity

economic consequences of the epidemic with special focus on enabling access to critical supplies and equipment gt had also very fruitful discussion with the President of the African Development Bank

fkxm6gb,I agree that it is not necessarily racist to not take it as seriously as do don expect everyone to think that hard about it which is one of the reasons am trying to explain my thinking behind the use of the term chinese virus or wuhan virus But world leaders and media elites definitely have responsibility to think through what they say and do not really give them the benefit of the doubt if they claim ignorance These people are professionals and know what their words do since it literally their job to speak to the public and persuade people It different from the average person who is trying to just do their job and provide for themselves and the people they care about and isn as used to thinking about these things think low level racial prejudice or distrust of outsiders is pretty common and don think that the biggest moral failing in the world Obviously people should try to be aware of it and work past it if they can But in this situation m less considered about the offense caused by racial prejudice and more concerned with the very real harm that can be caused by common racial prejudice racial national stigmatization whether that the primary intent or not health and economic crisis since this is very dangerous recipe We should all try to be really careful with our language in this time and try to spread that awareness to others We are living through very serious and unpredictable situation Also take the point about the incident cited being in Canada but there have been many other instances around the world ve seen headlines about corona related attacks in Israel on an east asian looking Indian Israeli And in my hometown of NYC which is very diverse and normally tolerant there has already been an uptick in harassment and attempted assaults on asian americans ,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

fl59zzi,Okay so you think we don have enough data to draw conclusion You still managed to make some pretty astounding conclusions despite that Do you really think the situation will stabilize in two weeks We re on track for cases by the end of April if not more Have you not seen what is happening in Italy They ve been dealing with this shit for months There no end in sight for them If they can get grip on it after dealing with it for over month m pretty sure the US is far away from seeing an end to the crisis We still have morons gathering on the beach en masse You really seem to have just looked at some data in vacuum ignored what the best experts are saying and concluded it less deadly than the flu so we don need to worry Practically every epidemiological mind on earth says that you re not just wrong but hilariously wrong This doesn feel like good faith argument at all These two parts in particular stick out to me as Olympic level mental gymnastics gt The CFR in Germany is currently and even they aren detecting asymptomatic cases It is very likely that the true CFR is less than perhaps significantly less Italy has case fatality rate of around https www thelancet com journals langlo article PIIS fulltext Another poster noted that South Korea which by far has had the most success dealing with this thing is still seeing CFR of Should take either of these examples and apply to it to all cases of Covid outbreaks No of course not Every situation is different Germany CFR being low could be due to number of factors lower transmission genetic components we have no understanding of yet selection bias in the sample lag in deaths from the newness of the outbreak and literally dozens of other things Experts don know ton but they all seem to agree that it deadlier than the flu Global Covid CFR is probably around conservatively https www nejm org doi full NEJMoa gt Now people say that overwhelming the medical system will lead to higher fatality rate and that likely true Yes gt But normal causes of hospitalization and death aren going away either and the longer hospitals are in coronavirus mode the more likely you are to die of heart attack or stroke Overwhelming hospitals will have folks dying of heart attacks strokes gall bladders bursting gun shot wounds and myriad of other normally treatable conditions hell of lot more quickly than proactively mitigating the damage from Covid Burnt out healthcare workers make mistakes The economic damage from just letting the floodgates be unleashed would be tremendous as bad or worse than taking the steps we are taking now gt Flattening the curve and prolonging the epidemic might lead to fewer deaths due to lack of ventilators but more deaths due to internal bleeding while doctors are dealing with the pandemic This is the exact opposite of what every researcher says If we don flatten the curve and we have infection rate with requiring hospitalization that would put us at million people in need of hospitalization That times more hospital beds than we would have in best case scenario We might have hospital beds in the entire country If we have million hospitalizations between now and August how the fuck is the hospital going to have time for anything else Not to mention that we would have significantly higher mortality rate for Covid itself because there no way we are going to be able to supply million or more respirators between now and the end of April when they would likely be needed This doesn even account for personnel shortages nationwide ICU nurses for million patients over months Not to mention these folks are almost certainly themselves going to get sick and be unable to perform their job What about the doctors We have doctor shortage in the US as things stand today We only have around doctors per people in the US and not all of them are hospital docs Even if they all wen to treating Covid cases full time we only have million doctors for million cases across country nearly the size of Europe Take that case up against rosier scenario where we have extreme measures in place infection rate limits hospitalization to We would still struggle immensely and it would require fuckload of work to manage million new folks in American hospitals but it would at least be somewhat possible know my tone is super combative and for that do apologize but holy shit just listen to the experts Not listening to the experts is why we are in this mess in the first place They seem to think it a serious fucking problem and they spend lot more time working on this than internet shitposters on Reddit do ping DUNK,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

change it coronavirus outer sheath This means as the body goes through the normal immune loop to produce an anti body for Generation of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide ie the asymptomatic day day period yes it a bell curve and some people can go potentially longer than days and be infectious without symptoms The virus mutates and new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti bodies and the immune loop process repeats Another click on the chamber gun The body resolves that potentially day process and gets Gen but by that time Gen Gen Gen may now exist the same loop the same click of the gun This is why HIV anti virals appear to be the only working solution for doctors at the moment You catch this and theoretically could need to be on anti virals for the rest of your life just like AIDS patients Part of it genetically modified traits is an entirely new never seen before in nature protein that deals with how it infects the body This is why the rating and chance of being infected is so alarming It airborne it a small microbe microns and just being around someone not showing symptoms can infect via them just breathing Or if they use the toilet as it passes through fecal matter that another person using same bathroom is at high risk of infection so public washrooms should be avoided if there is cluster in your area The bottom line the media is downplaying the severity of this but countries are preparing for it as in judge by what they do not what they say What they say are lies What they do is more important in exposing that lie You don lock down million people in China for the flu What concerns some people who are working on this problem is that the virus although is only to serious because of the mutations it could theoretically be fatal for anyone catching it without medical treatments over time It still too early to confirm that so it a very doomy theory As was told this has the potential to wipe Humanity off the map and can become as common as the common cold now that it part of our viral ecology Add to that you can catch it multiple times it Noval no herd immunity meaning no one is immune You might catch someone Gen Gen Gen infection while you just have Gen causing much more severe chances of going critical and dying if you are around big cluster of infection It was designed to kill that is its job It is weapon Not designed to give you hug and kisses The reason why people are not alarmed China is covering up the deaths burning bodies en mass and lying Iran had leak that over are now dead as of yesterday and that number no doubt is higher today Once you present symptoms and you body recovers the encephalitis portion of the protein sequence is attacking the nervous system where it hard for blood to access and present antibodies the nervous system infection is what is causing people who appear fine to suddenly drop into seizure and die That kick effect is pretty much sudden death as death can happen within minute of that event Assuming pneumonia and hypoxia depleted oxygen doesn kill you event or organ failure ie heart attack liver failure etc event if it in your nervous system event will It a multi tiered killer lots of regions of the body this is affecting Lungs Organs Nervous system Death can come from all three regions of infection and depending on the person this is also part of that bell curve so it seems about days average after symptoms to go into critical but can be longer everyone is different and this also has gain of function meaning it gets nastier as it adapts to you and can become even more lethal not dropping traits but gaining traits as it evolves unlike natural virus that can have loss of function ie become harmless like the cold That is why this is real doom folks not fake doom or fake news It doesn care what you believe if had bunker right now d be in one but don But many CEOs seem to be bugging out It the masses who don know but trust me lots of people in power know what this is However the ministry of propaganda is controlling information ie the infodemic that the WHO talks about saying to them it scarier than the virus but the reality is it will expose the agenda or event reality of this planned mass depopulation event ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

fkzih8q,Most Grand Princess passengers in quarantine refused coronavirus tests often at federal officials urging Despite assurances from Vice President Mike Pence that all Grand Princess cruise ship passengers quarantined at Travis Air Force Base would be tested for COVID The Chronicle has learned that two thirds of them have declined often at the encouragement of federal health officials As of Wednesday of the passengers screened while confined turned down the test federal official familiar with the Travis quarantine and testing told The Chronicle The low testing numbers align with what passengers were told by officials during Tuesday afternoon teleconference citing acceptance rate for the novel coronavirus test several passengers told The Chronicle These folks know they are in day quarantine if they test positive they are further delayed until they test negative said the official who The Chronicle agreed not to name because they were not authorized to speak to the media in accordance with the paper ethics policy They don want to stay They want to be released Those who spoke to The Chronicle said federal health officials dissuaded them from taking the test saying if they had no symptoms during the mandatory day quarantine test was unnecessary The federal official and cruise passengers also said the test compliance would have been higher had tests been available to administer shortly after they were removed from the ship and sent to the base The low test numbers fly in the face of what government officials had promised after the passengers many California residents were removed from the stricken Grand Princess cruise line beginning March and sent to military facilities across the country Twenty one people aboard the cruise ship tested positive while it was quarantined off the coast of California before docking at the Port of Oakland We will be testing everyone on that ship Pence said March in White House briefing Two days later the S Department of Health and Human Services which is overseeing the Travis operation also said passengers would be tested But it appears that most will return to their homes with no COVID test results In response to series of questions White House official told The Chronicle No one can be forced to be tested All passengers were screened and all were offered testing However past court rulings indicate the government would be allowed to order testing for the coronavirus during health emergency said Dorit Reiss law professor at UC Hastings in San Francisco Stanford law professor Michelle Mello agreed saying the government could force test if there was an order that explained why testing is reasonable and necessary Strictly speaking people do not have to comply with such orders in the sense that we don strap people to hospital gurney and extract biospecimens from them Mello said in an email But if they refuse public health authorities can order them into isolation until such time as the period of dangerousness contagiousness has passed They can also criminally prosecute them and seek imprisonment or fines Brian Ferguson spokesman for California Office of Emergency Services said the state was told early on that passengers would be isolated and that those with underlying conditions symptoms or higher risk factors would be tested statement from the Health and Human Services department said that the federal government can force anyone to be tested but said those at Travis can still opt for testing at later date The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not return requests for comment don know if the governor of California knows they are not required to be tested when they are released into the community the federal official said In reality don know if anyone knows that they can decline Infectious disease experts say so little is known about coronavirus that there are no binary answers about whether testing should be required before someone is released from quarantine You don want to have or so people re seeding their communities when they are released said George Rutherford UCSF professor of epidemiology There aren absolutes person could be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic and still infectious Now Playing Here is what you need to know about the coronavirus Video Manjula Varghese Rutherford called the claims that federal test administrators were dissuading passengers from getting tested crazy John Swartzberg UC Berkeley infectious disease expert said it likely day quarantine would be sufficient but he has other worries am concerned that we continue to get false information from Pence and others Swartzberg said in an email am not concerned about the passengers as long as they are being released after days of quarantine past the incubation period The CDC reported that the incubation period lasts two to days However some studies have indicated the contagious period could last longer The situation developed around March after all the passengers had arrived at the Fairfield air base and federal officials wanted to begin swab testing The tests were delayed however due to lack of trained personnel protective gear and test kits the federal official said If they had been prepared and given us the option from day one we were here there would ve been much higher acceptance said former Grand Princess passenger Robert Archer who has been isolated with his wife Marlene With March release date looming the couple turned down the test Sunday The tests were in collection phase and it would have taken days for the test to come back Archer said If no results were back by our release date we ll get delayed he said If we get tested positive then we re not released until we get two or three negative tests in row each with its own delay Passengers were told when they arrived at Travis that it would be day quarantine If you had no symptoms during that period Archer said you were guaranteed your freedom We ve all been clinging to that he said For people here the breaking point is fast approaching The food is degrading People are on edge Swartzberg called the delay in test availability for not just Travis but the entire country reprehensible The blame goes squarely on the executive branch of our government and two of its agencies the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC the professor said The federal official said at other bases with smaller Grand Princess contingents the test decline rate was much lower Since arriving at Travis about passengers have shown symptoms and have been quarantined away from others Some of those people have tested positive Many of those individuals the federal official said had access to common spaces at Travis with those refusing tests On Tuesday six passengers in the larger population group were taken away by ambulance the federal official said On Sunday morning testers knocked on passenger Michelle Heckert door Later that day despite being told it was unnecessary Heckert and her grandparents got swabbed The CDC rep said don take the test if you are asymptomatic Heckert recalled They said days is generous amount of time for symptoms to manifest if you had it She said she was told it would take four to five days for results Her family release date is March We just wanted to feel safe for peace of mind Heckert said And we wanted to be able to tell people we been tested when we were able to be released Many passengers were surprised that declining the test was even an option she said As of Wednesday the testing of those who wanted it was completed but no test had yet been returned due to backlog There are only staffers at Travis trained to administer the test and the base was still waiting for required protective gear to be delivered the federal official said Archer anxiety has been rising with each day He said there been an average of three ambulance evacuations each day If they get out Archer said he and his wife would return to their Excelsior District home and shelter in place like everyone else in the Bay Area but they have their own beds food and surroundings And they wouldn be sharing facilities with other higher risk Grand Princess passengers It the same problem There one guideline by the federal government another guideline from the state and another guideline from the local government Archer said It amounted to

On January year old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County Washington with day history of cough and subjective fever On checking into the clinic the patient put on mask in the waiting room After waiting approximately minutes he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by provider He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan China The patient stated that he had seen health alert from the S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and because of his symptoms and recent travel decided to see health care provider Given the patient travel history the local and state health departments were immediately notified Together with the urgent care clinician the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for nCoV on the basis of current CDC persons under investigation case definitions Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens After specimen collection the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department On January the CDC confirmed that the patient nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for nCoV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rRT PCR assay In coordination with CDC subject matter experts state and local health officials emergency medical services and hospital leadership and staff the patient was admitted to an airborne isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact droplet and airborne precautions with eye protection On admission the patient reported persistent dry cough and day history of nausea and vomiting he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain Vital signs were within normal ranges On physical examination the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable After admission the patient received supportive care including liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea On days through of hospitalization days through of illness the patient vital signs remained largely stable apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia Figure The patient continued to report nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued On the afternoon of hospital day the patient passed loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort second episode of loose stool was reported overnight sample of this stool was collected for rRT PCR testing along with additional respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal and serum The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT PCR for nCoV whereas the serum remained negative Treatment during this time was largely supportive For symptom management the patient received as needed antipyretic therapy consisting of mg of acetaminophen every hours and mg of ibuprofen every hours He also received mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately liters of normal saline over the first days of hospitalization chest radiograph taken on hospital day illness day was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities Figure However second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day illness day showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung Figure These radiographic findings coincided with change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day when the patient oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as while he was breathing ambient air On day the patient was started on supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at liters per minute Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital acquired pneumonia treatment with vancomycin mg loading dose followed by administered intravenously every hours and cefepime administered intravenously every hours was initiated On hospital day illness day fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs finding consistent with atypical pneumonia Figure and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation Given the radiographic findings the decision to administer oxygen supplementation the patient ongoing fevers the persistent positive nCoV RNA at multiple sites and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia at period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy Treatment with intravenous remdesivir novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development was initiated on the evening of day and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day and cefepime was discontinued on the following day after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus On hospital day illness day the patient clinical condition improved Supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his oxygen saturation values improved to to while he was breathing ambient air The previous bilateral lower lobe rales were no longer present His appetite improved and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea As of January the patient remains hospitalized

fiynzen,Via https outline com Bfa wn Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan China the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear according to whistleblower complaint The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus according to lawyers for the whistleblower who is senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families unit within HHS The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar She was told Feb that if she does not accept the new position in days which is March she would be terminated The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field received two HHS department awards from Azar last year and has received the highest performance evaluations her lawyers said The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel an independent federal watchdog agency The whistleblower lawyers provided copy of redacted page complaint to The Washington Post spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office The complaint alleges that HHS staff were improperly deployed and were not properly trained or equipped to operate in public health emergency situation The complaint also alleges that the workers were potentially exposed to coronavirus because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment even though they had face to face contact with returning passengers The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said In her complaint the whistleblower states that appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine monitor or test the workers during their deployment and upon their return home The repatriated Americans were among those evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu like illness About ACF personnel were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County California and another team of about ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield California according to the complaint and the whistleblower lawyer Ari Wilkenfeld Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers according to person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria for testing which only calls for testing people who had recent travel to China or contact with confirmed case The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms the person said If they had appropriate protocol would have been followed The deployments took place Jan to around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March and Feb to Feb during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis The planes each carried about Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan After their deployments the workers returned to their normal duties some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country the lawyers said Our client was concerned that ACF staff who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities where they may have spread the coronavirus to others said Lauren Naylor one of the whistleblower lawyers The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep Jimmy Gomez Ca member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee according to Gomez spokesman During hearing Thursday Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from the Administration for Children and Families could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan China without any training in emergency response Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received and whether any of them were exposed to high risk evacuees from China Azar said They never should have been without P referring to personal protective equipment Asked whether any protocols may have been broken given the urgency on the ground Azar replied that urgency was never reason for breaking safety protocols don believe that has taken place Azar said said adding that health and safety protocols should always be followed He said that he did not personally know the names of the team but that other department officials did Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus Azar said d want to know the full facts and we take appropriate remedial efforts The whistleblower said she received an email Jan about potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans according to her lawyer She initially supported the efforts because they had the appearance that this was within ACF scope lawyer Lauren Naylor said But later she discovered the personnel were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS It was part of the agency all hands on deck mission Naylor said but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS Some workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground That person joined ACF in September and had no training or experience in any federal emergency management public health emergency response or safety or operational protocols to run the mission the complaint states ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters such as floods and fires and helping victims apply for temporary assistance all of which are under the category of human services the whistleblower lawyers said HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to health emergency for which they have no training Naylor said The Administration for Children and Families which has about employees has come under attack in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the S Mexico border who were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security She was involuntarily assigned to position in subject matter where she has no expertise said Wilkenfeld her lawyer in an interview Thursday The agency said the reason for the reassignment was necessary to meet the needs of the department according to memo she received If did not accept involuntary reassignment would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action according to her complaint

fjp8ia9,Why is South Korea experiencing an unprecedented spike in the COVID infection number Because the incubation period of covid is very long meaning that when the infection number started to spike that was only the results of the epidemic control measures of about days ago Despite the media and governmental attention on Shincheonji they have only been half of the problem The alarm bells didn work the containment measures were poor Reuters has very informative infographic site https graphics reuters com CHINA HEALTH SOUTHKOREA CLUSTERS G SB index html Basically the first untraceable community cases were patient and who were admitted to Seoul National Hospital on th Feb This means that patient and were infected at around the beginning of Feb Whether they are related to Shincheonji or not this should have been warning alarm for the South Korea healthcare authorities but it unfortunately wasn Patient was member of Shincheonji She started to show symptoms sometime around Feb th meaning that like case and she was infected sometimes in end of Jan and beginning of Feb On the th doctors advised her to to test for coronavirus but she didn listen went to several other places On the th she went to the hospital to test for covid and was tested positive She was subsequently assumed to be super spreader and blamed to the subsequent rise of infected cases But was she really super spreader The epidemic didn just suddenly come into existent in South Korea without at least imported case getting through unchecked Right after patient was discovered score of people were subsequently discovered to be infected On the th the total number of people infected was people On the th it was people By that time the infection was widespread enough inside Daegu for random military personnel with no known connection to Shincheonji visiting his home to catch it and go on infecting several others inside the military which should have been the reserve resources when the epidemic spread nationally but was in actuality compromised and deactivated early on These people weren infected the day before they were discovered They were infected sometime between weeks ago at the beginning of Feb From then on the reported infected cases have started to climb on very clearly exponential graph Despite the media attention it was very clearly that patient was unlikely to be the cause of the infection for the people discovered on the th and th but they all were likely to be infected at around the same time at the end of Jan and beginning of Feb The disease has been silently transmitting among the populace for half month the alarm bell of which should have been the discovery of patient and never mind patient Unfortunately even when patient started to show symptoms there was no action from the South Korean government and healthcare authorities to at the very least quarantine the suspected case from going all over the place In hindsight they were basically choosing the rights to be idiots of the Shincheonji cult over the health of and counting South Korean citizens Furthermore in the Reuters graphic you can see that there are at least clusters in development Shincheonji Cheongdo Daenam Hospital Busan Onchun Church and others Cheongdo Daenam Hospital was also where the brother of the Shinchoeonji leader died and had funeral from January to February and the brother died of you guessed it pneumonia To sum it up somebody died of pneumonia in the middle of an epidemic and no healthcare authorities moved to verify whether the dead had covid or not and allowed said funeral to last days with several thousands visitors in hospital with lots of patients in the mental ward and immuno compromised and old people place where would be the most dangerous source of transmission if compromised Which it was Furthermore even after Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk blew up as of Feb th days after patient tested positive and it became clear that Shincheonji was part of the problem the South Korean government refused to restrict travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk to other provinces and countries just because China did it so it must be bad and human rights violation kid you not an excerpt from Washington Post https www washingtonpost com world asia pacific in south korea region is stricken with coronavirus but no china style lockdowns planned e bf ea efd bdd story html When spokesman for South Korea ruling party suggested Tuesday that the government would be rolling out maximum lockdown on the coronavirus hit southern city of Daegu the backlash was immediate and the political retreat swift Hong Ihk pyo soon clarified that he didn mean Wuhan style lockdown or blockade on travel into and out of the city along the lines that China Communist Party has imposed on Wuhan and surrounding areas at the center of the covid outbreak President Moon Jae in soon chimed in There would be no regional blockade he said only full scale effort to contain the spread of the virus The measures include tracing and testing potential carriers canceling large public gatherings and marshaling the country medical and financial resources with help from the police and the military But as South Korea struggles to contain rapid acceleration in coronavirus infections one thing is clear The kind of tactics imposed by the authoritarian regime in China are simply not on the menu in this compact democratic and politically outspoken country Of South Korea nearly confirmed cases of the disease named covid caused by the novel coronavirus are in Daegu and another in the neighboring province of North Gyeongsang with major burst of cases linked to megachurch All but one of the deaths have taken place in the city or province Some kind of travel restriction on Daegu citizens might have been helpful to contain the virus but it was just out of the question said Choi Eun hwa professor of medicine at Seoul National University and member of an expert panel that met Moon on Monday The South Korean government can afford to enforce that kind of restriction as it would spark huge backlash Yeah and as far as know they still haven restricted travel from Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk as of now March th when the number of infected has surpassed the epidemic has spread to all South Korean provinces hospital in Seoul became new cluster of reported confirmed cases after importing case from Daegu while China is well on its way for recovery in part thanks to its strict travel restriction measures both inside the country and to other countries At the end of January China placed travel restriction on Chinese nationals in China from going on tours to other countries On February th the South Korean government accused the Vietnamese government of quarantining Korean nationals from Daegu to Vietnam without prior notice in the middle of pandemic when the number of cases in South Korea was in the The South Korean media subsequently labeling countries with special focus on Vietnam that have imposed travel restriction on travelers from South Korea Koreaphobic despite anyone with eyes can see that the epidemic was blowing up fast in South Korea and the South Korea government still hadn restricted travel for its nationals within the country and to other countries In comparison despite China initially putting pressure on countries that had put travel ban on travelers from China China response and travel ban of its citizens to other countries even if bit late was downright charitable To sum up part The South Korean government lack of containment measures when things start to go off the rail made the epidemic uncontainable now and the alarm bells within weeks didn work ,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

fkyv7qf,Well for starters the AP refused to certify the results of the Iowa caucus because of wide spread irregularities Errors in tabulation that the Iowa Democratic party admitted to but absurdly refused to correct An entire precinct that was not counted at all because another precinct was counted twice at its expense The Iowa Democratic party president had to resign over the mess The results were not released for over week An opaque state delegate equivalent allocation system that resulted in Pete getting more SDEs than Bernie even though Bernie won more votes in the caucus Then you have the Texas primary where flash drives from tabulating machines in Dallas county were unaccounted for and then discovered after the initial totals were released Judge has allowed recount to happen because of that travesty In addition there were such wide spread closures of polling places all across TX that students and poor people often had to wait in line for several hours One man said he had to wait in line for hours to cast his vote Then you have the thousands of provisional ballots that were not counted in CA You have nearly mail in ballots rejected in WA because small box on the envelope affirming the Democratic party values was left unchecked by voters In AZ you had third of the polling stations closed in the poorest Latino heavy most populous counties at the last minute due to coronavirus fears But the primary itself was not postponed despite the social distancing recommendations by the CDC Similar polling place closures happened in FL and IL In IL people reported showing up at their polling place to find out no paper ballots and no voting machines had been provided at all There is plenty of independent reporting on the huge discrepancy between the exit polls and the actual vote totals always in favor of Biden and to the detriment of Bernie When you add up all of the irregularities from this cycle and from it easy to infer that the Democratic party wants progressive votes in November but not our voices during the primaries ck them ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fjysh3x, gt Difference with singapore was they were proactive from the very beginning same with Hong Kong and very public about it Do you think Canada has been not public about it certainly applaud their approach it is great move m just not sure what this means for Canada gt They have very low number of cases and have largely contained the outbreak here its almost joke when talking about it No one know has clue what to do when to stay home what are the onset symptoms Where the infected travelled Who knows how many people have been infected got symptoms but thought it was the flu because they couldn trace the steps of the infected To be fair that also MUCH harder to do when you re the nd largest country in the world Advice given to people in Hong Kong and Singapore will be relevant to of people in HK and Singapore but advice given Canada wide will likely only be relevant to of the people if that The relevant advice is always wash your hands don cough uncovered keep distances don shake hands If you travel and you re sick call hospitals they ll test you What more do you think should be said or done gt Who knows how many people have been infected got symptoms but thought it was the flu because they couldn trace the steps of the infected One of the signs that this happens called community spreading is if someone comes to the hospital with covid symptoms the hospital tests them and confirms they have the virus and they find out the person didn travel and get it abroad If they can trace where exactly this person got the infection from that means it is spreading within the country There are measures in place for this already gt When comparing the two countries with Canada we are doing everything reactive No we aren See these https www reddit com canada comments ffcv canadas response has been exemplary when it comes fjybl two comments https www reddit com canada comments ffcv canadas response has been exemplary when it comes fjyac gt have yet to hear anything proactive in our approach to the virus Just because you don hear it doesn mean it not happening Are you doctor An epidemiologist Are you somehow involved in the medical field Do you know what the actual guidelines and procedures are Just because you don hear it doesn mean it not happening Health Canada is hard at work and so far is on the ball Don get me wrong know it will hit the fan soon the disease is already spreading like mad in the US and it will make its way up into Canada sooner rather than later It is impossible to stop that from happening At present however Health Canada is doing great job finding and isolating the sick people to prevent an outbreak It can save us but it can delay the progress of the disease so we don look like Italy or Iran just yet gt You mentioned Iran but when the first case popped up in BC our health officials were blind sided with the news Define health officials Do you mean ministers and people working in government Or do you mean the actual medical experts There a very big difference between the two Doctors talk to each other as part of their job and they know what going around Health officials as government workers have much more rigid hierarchy and strictly defined roles so information goes slower through the government This is normal and unfortunately unavoidable gt Every time it was an announcement about finding case it was because they got sick and called the health authorities these were people had traveled abroad walked into Canada and pushed off calling until they were too sick How else are they supposed to find who is or isn sick If Canada can do covid tests day and people enter and leave the country day how are you supposed to find who is sick What the experts have done is decide to focus those efforts on people who are actually sick and telling the population at large to call the hospitals if they have worries You can just find who is sick it takes time consuming and expensive tests to do that and testing everyone at random is inefficient Instead you follow up on people who are sick find them isolate them find everyone who was in contact with them get them to self isolate and monitor the situation closely so the disease doesn spread That exactly what Health Canada has done This isn just reactionary doing nothing This is pro actively following well researched plan that allows for quickly and efficiently isolating patients to prevent outbreaks from happening in the population at large and so far it been working We have one case in BC that we can trace the disease to outside travels or to people who have travelled That means there likely is community spreading and now Health Canada is going to jump on that and target that area to try and contain and isolate people before there is an outbreak This is where the kind of communication from Singapore and Hong Kong become relevant and important because that what you do when you have an actual outbreak as opposed to just sick people coming in from abroad If it spreads in BC and it probably will that when you can see what exactly health Canada is doing in BC and if they re being proactive enough So far they caught every fireball thrown our way and prevented wildfire There was nothing else to do Now we re starting to have fire domestically so let see if we ll be able to contain it yeah gt Now its community infections people arent going to be that cognitive to call in as it will be the flu until things get bad for them And now is also great time to put together more informative pamphlets and distribute the information more efficiently If you tell people to prepare and plan but nothing happens for month they tend to forget the plan If we still fail to communicate to people effectively from now on that a serious problem but it hasn been problem yet gt Now the steps that Singapore took many not be the best course for us because the that method for tracking is about creating the web of connection it only works if you control the input e border controls if you have unknown leak plugging one hole wont fix the issue We messed up our response plan and simple You can expect Canada to take the same approach as Singapore it would be like telling farmer they shouldn use pesticides and should simply go and pick the weeds by hand after all you do it in your garden and it works fine right The two situations are completely different It is all about knowing that web of connection and that exactly what Health Canada has been doing and exactly how they know that there is come community spreading in BC right now Again just because you don see Health Canada being proactive doesn mean it not happening The thing with border control is that it doesn work You can only tell who is sick until after they start showing symptoms In Canada we also can close the border without immediately crashing the economy and it also not going to make difference anyways The disease is spreading like mad in the US and it will make its way north into Canada from there no matter what we do Health Canada hasn failed by allowing community spreading in BC Health Canada has succeeded in delaying outbreaks until now It was never going to be question of stopping the disease from getting into Canada the moment it infected more than countries it would be impossible to prevent it from spreading world wide Coronavirus is more contagious than the flu the symptoms are non specific it looks like the flu it takes weeks from the moment you re infected to present symptoms and you can spread the disease without showing any symptoms Those are literally all the worst things virus can have to make it an epidemiologist nightmare the only thing that could make it worse is if it was carried by say birds So yeah the disease was going to make its way into Canada sooner or later The fact we don currently look like Italy or Iran is due to Health Canada being proactive and containing the disease early on unlike China who didn act fast enough and unlike the US which is still denying that it happening in the first place We have not messed up our response plan our response plan is working exactly as intended to delay outbreaks in Canada An epidemic is inevitable but the longer we hold off the better prepared we will be Every health expert in the nation knows this ,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

fjsu1n7, gt Wade when the wages of the top half of America keep going up prices rise to match it The problem is if the wages of the bottom half of America stay the same than the prices of things keep increasing but their money they re making doesn That only applies for the things that the wealthy buy Sure if the extremely wealthy have lots more money the price of Lamborghini goes up That doesn affect the lives of the non wealthy except in the sense that if some of them happen to work for the Lamborghini company it can now afford to pay them better The price of milk and bread and pair of sneakers doesn change gt you look at the price of can of Coke back in the fifties and it was like map that increase in that price from the the vs the amount of the minimum wage increase from the to is not equal The cost of the can of Coke went up more in the minimum wage so somebody working minimum wage in is paying larger share of their income for can of Coke than somebody who was working minimum wage in The problem with your example is that the cost of coke in the isn really s price it is an price https en wikipedia org wiki Fixed price of Coca Cola from to Its hard to find better example of cherry picking That said only about of full time workers earn minimum wage and wages are currently rising faster than inflation fastest for the low end What will make them rise even faster is securing the border and removing the illegal aliens currently in the country gt but acting like we need to sacrifice everybody else in the countryy just to pay down this imaginary debt yes it imaginary it only exists on computer on ledger it all theoretical money that hasnt even been physically printedd just not going to work It isn imaginary unfortunately The money in the Social Security Trust fund is imaginary the government took and spent that decades ago and all that in there now is IOUs The national debt is very real and trillions of it is owed to other countries We spent billion last year making interest payments on it In we made billion in interest payments Since you like the in the last year we made payment on the principal of the debt it was billion The problem we have right now is the interest payments is all we make and we keep borrowing more If we keep going this way in years the interest payments will exceed our revenues and the problem we run into there which will likely begin to manifest before that is that the countries lending us money will begin demanding higher interest rates for their loans on shorter terms that the loans be made in their currencies rather than ours and eventually will stop lending to us at all as high risk We can of course at any point declare all debts held by the US null and void repudiating the debt The problem with this idea is that we have fiat currency That means our money is not backed by gold or any real thing and is worth only what everyone else believes it is and that belief is based on our ability to repay our debts and the use of our money as the world reserve currency and the petrodollar If we repudiate our debt our money will become worth less than the paper it is printed on virtually overnight There are already movements internationally to move away from the dollar as the world reserve currency and to move away from the petrodollar for trading oil If we repudiate our debt those movements will become reality immediately and at that point we re basically screwed For example one of the things the coronavirus is teaching us is that of our medical supplies and of our drugs are manufactured in China If our money is worthless we can buy those things So it is imperative that we get our spending under control and begin to pay down the debt In the military was of our Federal Budget and of our budget went to pay down the debt In the military is of our budget and we spent more than our revenues That can continue ,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

investigation is uncovering the real grasp of how many people are actually infected by COVID As result of this increase Ontario has suspended public schools for weeks excluding march break With the drastic increase of new cases and the potential for more each day will be switching to table format for the information on each cases instead of just writing it out previously Its essentially just copying the table on the Ontario website right now but the problem with that one is that they don show the previous cases only the new ones ll be going back through my previous posts to compile all the info ve previously typed so that the table will have all the cases Some silver lining with the current situation so we re not all doom and gloom all the current cases we ve had are all in self isolation This means that none of their conditions are severe enough for hospitalization Furthermore there has been no additional cases of community transmission today cases all had travel history or were in close contact with previous positive case Finally we re now past cases testing tested with the large increases happening during the past few days showing the expansion of testing capabilities

fkrg84o,Ok let have look at how this thing happened In January when this virus thing first happened there are plenty of comments from the US politicians criticizing the Chinese government They blame the Chinese government for suppressing the severe situation for not locking down Wuhan and violation of human rights for locking down Wuhan There are other ridiculous ideas like spreading of the virus in China helps the economics of the US Mike Pompeo insists on using Chinese virus in interviews when WHO has officially called it CODIV The Chinese government is not happy with these reactions warning the US government to not do things based on cold war thought Also the Chinese government is unhappy that the US government never officially helped China which is also kind of ridiculous As you may already read there are articles in English saying that the virus might come out of the Wuhan lab There are also articles in Chinese saying the virus was brought by the US army in November These articles before Feb can only be found in some private Chinese social media which was never mentioned by the Chinese official media These articles normally draw the conclusion first and have timeline of indirect evidence showing that the US government is suspicious If you have average IQ as do you ll know these are not likely to be the truth However things changed after the virus spread in the US and the US CDC announced that some previous death because of flu was actually because of the virus They didn say who the patient and when that happened The Chinese government found this weapon and decided to attack back They did it in smart way that officially they announced the source of the virus is scientific question and the conclusion should be based on research However the new spokesman Lijian Zhao says the virus could come from the US and ask for an explanation from the US government on Twitter probably inspired by Trump himself Also Beijing never officially said that Then during call between Pompeo and Jiechi Yang Pompeo officially says that the US is unhappy with Lijian Zhao condemn and believes it not the time to spread lies In return Jiechi Yang is unhappy about US politicians ridiculous judgments on Chinese efforts for stopping the virus Trump himself as an honest politician probably didn know anything about Zhao twitter in the beginning In news conference several days ago when asked about Zhao twitter he after praising Chinese government for having good numbers on infected cases and showing off his good relationship with Xi says he didn know what happened but believes everybody knows where it virus comes from Now probably after listening to report from Pompeo or other of his coworkers he decided to attack back on Twitter by calling it virus Before that Trump has never called it the Chinese virus neither officially nor on Twitter So in general nobody really cares about where the virus comes from if they do it will be scientific arguing with tons of jargons that most of us won be able to fully understand It just used as weapon by both governments to attack each other This fight is interesting because both countries are acting relatively friendly on the surface but quite aggressive on Twitter From the perspective of the US people the Chinese government will be ridiculous and evil because the virus is from China since it first found there For Chinese people it will just deepen the evil image of some US politicians They probably won know about Zhao twitter because Twitter is website that never exists Sadly we won see the two strongest countries in the world help each other this time like what happened in Wenchuan earthquake in or during Katrina in ,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

figeooj, gt wanted source for there being projects to mutate corona virus You provided sources that studies on past corona viruses was going on You should have been more explicit in your question That not what you asked Obviously there is no way to know what unpublished work was being done It can only be observed what kind of work was primary focus of the laboratory and under the specialist umbric of the people who worked there If any bioweapons research was being done there it would undoubtedly be classified There are number of phrases suggesting that mutagenic impacts were being analyzed China wasn the only place conducting this kind of work and the lab is cited as source of various materials and samples in papers published from other places Obviously it pretty intuitive that work being done on virus would be important to understand the function of infectivity and possible genetic transcription impacts This is true whether for the purpose of public safety research or for more military based research In lab itself sequenced number of extracted samples and found that there was wide variety of coronavirus strains To do this it would be reasonable to assume the samples had to be procured and stored for analysis Given that number of follow up studies were done over the past seven years it is reasonable that the process would involve keeping cultures rather than gathering additional samples when needed The labratory was the first to successfully isolate the virus https www ecohealthalliance org wp content uploads Ge et al Bat SARS like CoV that uses ACE Nature pdf We can assess that the team at the institute had high degree of specialization in extremely infectious diseases BSL level facilities are designed expressly for the capacity to handle these types of pathogens in particular live strains Given the proximity to the outbreak don see how an accidental release can be ruled out without definitive chain of transmission through natural processes can be proven To date such chain has not been adequately demonstrated note you didn source one as such it is matter of two distinct possibilities both of which are potential avenues gt Are you suggesting that the virus is bioweapon that went directly from lab to humans without using animals for initial spread Or do you think that since couple of months after it appears we still don know which animal it came from it must be bioweapon am not suggesting any particular route of transmission There are number of ways that such transfer could occur direct virus escape is possible Failed sanitation processes when working with live virus are possible Escape or deportation of an infected lab animal is possible Ultimately there are many paths to systemic breakdown that can occur Most such scenarios involve the usual problem the typical weak point in most security systems the human element Such errors can be do to malice cascading mistakes or single point of failure Accidents of this nature are not unprecedented in either industry or research labs At the same time natural chain of events is also plausible Until either possibility is confirmed or much harder absolutely ruled out both are valid hypothesis,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

fkjfy2y,Chicagoan here am unbelievably worried Forgive me for the length of this comment but am tense and am angry My mind is going million miles an hour right now just biked seven miles across the city and was horrified by the crowds of people doing the exact opposite of social distancing tonight As most everyone knows this weekend we celebrate St Patrick Day This is very large celebration in Chicago city with tremendous Irish heritage It is also quite frankly an excuse for people to get sloshed Were it not for this pandemic would probably be out with them But m not turned my friends down and have been self isolating for three days now Let me tell the internet why guess Last summer abruptly moved back home with my parents and when split with my partner of seven years It probably for the best that did because my mother has laundry list of chronic health conditions She is morbidly obese and anemic this is an ongoing problem that we re actually still trying to determine the reason for She has history of complications from lower respiratory infections she had pneumonia twice last year and has scar tissue in her lungs as result She has the beginnings of heart disease as well as an aortic aneurysm that is currently being monitored every six months yep m not joking She is still working and actually works very high stress job in healthcare administration but her health emergencies are ongoing She has been working from home all week If bring this virus home to my mother or she is infected elsewhere she could die At And then there myself am unsure how much of risk this virus is to me personally m young only m very active though am overweight working on it do have adult onset asthma Since my diagnosis ve had few rounds of bronchitis and resulting asthma flare ups was on twice daily controller medication for year but am actually doing really well now and have been able to go off controller medication My asthma is well controlled have my albuterol inhaler for emergencies and that it As far as understand it both bronchitis and pneumonia are considered lower respiratory infections unlike the common cold which is an upper respiratory infection history of lower respiratory infections seems to indicate greater susceptibility to them in the future m fairly confident if get infected with this virus am going to have ROUGH time On the other hand also don truly have any reason to believe ll die or like need ventilator Despite my history of asthma and LRIs my lungs are functionally normal right now and m otherwise healthy Still it important to remember that this virus is novel to humans We can predict everything about its behavior with the same accuracy that we can virus that has been around for long time It hasn been studied extensively Quite simply we don totally know what it going to do to every group of people This whole thing is also so crazy to me for personal reasons because the only reason ever joined Reddit eight years ago was to track the Ebola outbreak LOL ve always tracked viruses and outbreaks as just like hobby and have never felt this way about one EVER Every credible source is saying this is going to be unlike anything we ve ever seen Anyway ve been reading everything can find all week Every statistic every study every opinion m not panicking because of the media m panicking because all evidence ve read indicates my mother is highly likely to experience complications if she contracts this virus Because believe that my history with asthma and lower respiratory infections might be risk factor as well Because scientific authorities NOT politicians are saying that this is about to explode The writing on the wall We are trying to slow it down not contain it at this point Staying apart will save lives Even Trump in all his idiocy seems to be acknowledging the severity of this Of course have zero faith in his ability to lead in crisis and believe real political upheaval is on the horizon now as well lived through and this feels like something on that scale Like there going to be pre and post coronavirus divide in my memories now It just inevitable Last summer my mom was in the emergency room at Northwestern for bout of gastrointestinal bleeding It was massive internal bleed that led to hospitalization as well as her ongoing anemia The ED was full and they had no room for her all night She laid in the hallway in bed bleeding until the morning came and they finally got her room This is woman WHO WORKS FOR large hospital not Northwestern to be clear She has the best health insurance available She has the means to pay for pretty much anything in terms of medical treatment None of that matters when there aren enough doctors and nurses to go around Unless you re fucking Jeff Bezos or the President money not going to buy you doctor in the midst of public health crisis of this scale Do you want people to die peacefully surrounded by those they love or do you want them to die in the next three months in hospital hallway without care because hospitals are slammed with patients and doctors are collapsing from exhaustion Do you want those doctors to have to pick and choose who gets treatment To have to turn people away over and over because they don have enough ventilators But yeah bars and restaurants were packed tonight Big crowds in Lakeview and River North People carrying on as if authorities aren BEGGING people to stay home and socially distance themselves At the corner of Clark and Ohio man and his friends yelled out to me Nice bike yelled back GO HOME As was coming South on LaSalle the Board of Trade loomed into view sat back in my saddle bit and looked up Living here frequently take the cityscape for granted It my everyday But tonight felt so different felt like needed to burn it all into my memory just in case In case m stuck inside for weeks or months evading this stupid fucking virus as well as my friends and loved ones who are currently refusing to stay home if they can It breaks my heart to see them doing this but there nothing can say to convince them They know what they re doing They just don care also have lot of friends in the service industry or who work only part time or are paid under the table or are having their hours cut already have friends who are comedians and musicians who are having gigs canceled left and right and don know how they re going to afford to live Welcome to the gig economy in major metropolis They have rent to pay and food to buy don blame them one bit for going to work if they can They are trapped Those bartenders and servers and cooks out there exposing themselves to these crowds tonight need their wages They need their tips They have to expose themselves to infection to pay rent It so fucked This country is so fucked you guys So unbelievably fucked My city about to experience public health crisis the likes of which hasn been seen in century All because of some combination of selfishness apathy ignorance and misinformation And because people can afford not to go to work tonight When we look back on this crisis in the future historians will study and acknowledger the role economic disparity played also think addiction plays part as to be totally honest there are people out there who truly value going out to the bars more than anything else More than their own lives and the lives of their loved ones This makes me so sad to think about And some of them they re just young They re immature They re carefree They haven developed enough awareness of the consequences of their actions yet They will soon enough Ultimately there nothing can do My Reddit comment won save the day If m wrong awesome would be so fucking happy to be wrong about everything coming ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0

fg5kcuk,From link As the new Wuhan coronavirus has spread not only all over mainland China but also worldwide panic is rising Inside China there is growing sense of helplessness as the government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China asking How can we protect ourselves and our families The epidemic could have been controlled fairly easily three weeks ago had there been more openness swift action and no attempted cover up But now it too late and this virus is spreading globally Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV the Wuhan pneumonia and infection has spread throughout China the government is forced to turn to its SARS playbook And that means entire cities must be cut off and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease spreading behavior It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon know people are very frightened And expect panic will rise in the coming days But very simple measures can protect you During the SARS epidemic traveled all over China and Hong Kong interviewed people infected with the virus doctors and nurses treating the disease government officials police everybody was never concerned that would become infected despite being in the room with sick individuals And that because knew what precautions to take Here are the most important ones to know When you leave your home wear gloves winter mittens or outdoor gloves and keep them on in subways buses and public spaces If you are in social situation where you should remove your gloves perhaps to shake hands or dine do not touch your face or eyes no matter how much something itches Keep your hands away from contact with your face And before you put your gloves back on wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water scrubbing the fingers Put your gloves on Change gloves daily washing them thoroughly and avoid wearing damp gloves Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless it disgusting as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria rarely wear face mask in an epidemic and have been in more than outbreaks Instead stay away from crowds and keep my distance from individual people half meter about feet is good standard If someone is coughing or sneezing ask them to put on mask to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids If they decline step meter about feet away from them or leave Don shake hands or hug people politely beg off saying it better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic Inside your household remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member Wash all towels twice week Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses like common colds flus and yes coronaviruses Be careful with doorknobs If it possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders do so Wear gloves to turn doorknob or wash your hands after touching it If anybody in your home takes sick wash your doorknobs regularly Similarly be cautious with stairway banisters desktops cell phones toys laptops any objects that are hand held As long as you handle only your own personal objects you will be ok but if you need to pick up someone else cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else computer keyboard be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object If you share meals do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils to remove food from serving bowl or plate and of course tell your children to never drink out of anybody else cups or from container of shared fluid It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes Don do this until the epidemic is over Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls return the serving spoon to the main dish and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices Absolutely do not buy slaughter or consume any live animal or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus When the weather allows open your windows at home or work letting your space air out The virus cannot linger in well ventilated space But of course if it is cold or the weather is inclement keep warm and close those windows Finally if you are caring for friend or family member who is running fever always wear tight fitting mask when you are near them and place one on the ailing person unless they are nauseated When you replace an old dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very very careful assume for the sake of your protection that it is covered in viruses and handle it while wearing latex gloves place it inside of disposable container seal it and then put it in the trash While wearing those latex gloves gently wash the patient face with warm soap and water using disposable paper towel or cotton swab and seal it after use in container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash Wear long sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water including sheets towels and utensils If you have space isolate the sick person in your household in room or corner of room where they are comfortable but separated from the rest of the household If the weather is tolerable open window that is on the opposite side of the room so that air gently blows past the patient face and then outdoors Of course don do this if it is very cold as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold The Chinese government will take very drastic actions over the next few weeks and this will be time of hardship for the Chinese people As the virus spreads in other countries similarly draconian measures may be invoked to slow the epidemic But with these simple precautions if taken by everybody in your household building office and school you will dramatically reduce the spread of the virus and bring the outbreak to its knees Be safe Do not panic Take commonsense precautions As frightening as this time is you will get through it ,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

fiainwp,I no expert on China or HK other than visiting HK for month in was pretty interesting The people were mostly like you find anywhere else in first world country and while there was clearly segment of the population that displayed the stereotypical Chinese don give fuck about copyrights or patents or QA or safety attitude it wasn pervasive or the norm from what witnessed and was told m your stereotypical white American devil genetically and accent yeah don hear it either but people who think have accents say we have accents so but experienced no apparent hostility other than scowls from couple young men when their girls laughed and exclaimed something or another while pointing at me with my frog umbrella https cdn bigcommerce com server pqt products images toy umbrella frog jpg Bruh wasn trying to swoop in and woo your girl with my blue eyes and even bigger eyes of my umbrella Just trying to stay dry in style and that was my favorite option at the and was apparently blazing the trail of HK umbrella fashion or maybe just an odd foreigner that failed to have an impact on HK umbrella fashion at all Either way the point is that frog umbrellas are highly recommended and jelly young men of HK need to get one if they want to keep up with me Aaaanyway Chinese society is more keyed in to reality than it appears on the outside The amount of surveillance censorship disinformation fear and lack of options to discourages publicly discussing things that are forbidden by the government like anything critical of the PRC or positive about what the PRC considers their enemies What happened in HK with the protestors was only possible because it not considered part of China by most of the HK citizens and hasn been for long time it was British colony prior to being technically handed back to the Chinese government by the UK few decades ago with the agreement that HK be allowed to operate under one country two systems rule where HK was technically considered part of China but functionally autonomous for something like IIRC Unfortunately it seems the PRC no longer feels the need to keep their side of that bargain though and as they enforce more and more of their will in HK law more and more of the HK citizens protest against it The thing is you don get what you want from the PRC by refusing to do what you re told unless you have way to prevent them from retaliating million people protesting in unity against PRC laws and subsequent vote that shows that it the will of the majority of the HK citizens is likey more of speed bump than great wall sadly The numbers aren a concern to the PRC but the international pressure and loss of income that would result from just disappearing so many people in such significant international hub and gateway to China do make the PRC step carefully while responding to this situation That not to say the PRC won do exactly what they want in the end just that they ll do slow less blatantly and provide distractions while they do it so that there won be as many repercussions as result In the end China can take huge economic hit and shrug it off since they have ton of resources finances and own lot of debt from other countries like the US so they could simply call in those debts and make up for any sanctions or losses they accrue as result if they have to and not really suffer for it It just matter of how much they care about their image and bottom line compared compared to how badly they want to enforce their will The latter is often very serious factor for the PRC If things turn out well for HK and the whole world doesn implode as result of the Corona virus d recommend visiting HK It an experience that is rather unique and the people are friendlier than lot of places from what ve found ,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

fkytfgt,There a lot of shallow thinking patterns show cased in your statement ll do my best to explain where your reasoning has gone wrong but sometimes there only so much can do hopefully this reaches you The mechanism that hurting Asians isn China actions or China need for reform The mechanism that hurting Asians is ignorance around the way people have internalized this incident Consider this would you ask Lebron James to speak for the actions of Boko Haram And further would you be inclined to justify using term like black terrorists or black killers by saying it because we need reform in Liberia And when the President of the United States insists on using the term black terrorism or black warlords over and over again despite being informed of the consequences and black Americans become the target of racist aggressions would you ever be inclined to suggest that it actually Boko Haram that harming black Americans and not the harmful rhetoric legitimized by the president over and over again And ultimately be honest with yourself do you really think calling Boko Haram bunch of black terrorists will create reform Or is it actual reform that will create reform As born and raised Canadian of Chinese descent can want reform in China but also want for me my wife my mother and my kids to not be dangerously associated with something as repulsive as killer virus all at the same time What you re suggesting is really no different than saying let fix this leak in your kitchen by burning the whole house down Reforming China and maintaining the innocence of innocent individuals can and must exist in the same room Don let idiots like Trump funnel you into these yes no on off black white Bill Reilly binary ways of thinking Please remember People of Chinese descent China Asking random person whom happens to be of Chinese descent whether or not he wants reform in China is just like asking Lebron James to speak on Boko Haram Or asking white person to speak for Ted Bundy Reforming China is not my or any one Chinese individual responsibility And if want to do so it ll be because believe so not because m Chinese and by default have something to do with CCP Most importantly me wanting reform will NOT be coming at the cost of the humanity and safety of my family and individuals of Chinese descent The scenario you re suggesting is unfortunately product of rather superficial levels of processing There nothing about individuals of Chinese descent fighting for their right to not be targets of racism and true reform in China that mutually exclude m suggesting that to create reform in China we should create reform in China You re suggesting that to create reform in China we should push rhetoric that does nothing but harm my kids ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fl80t75,Opinion Thank God the Doctor Is In Peeking out our windows we see America shriveling By Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist March Image Dr Anthony Fauci isn comfortable with everything President Trump spouts at coronavirus briefings Credit Jonathan Ernst Reuters WASHINGTON It not easy being national treasure m exhausted confessed Tony Fauci when reached him Thursday evening in the middle of another hour workday have changed my tune bit probably thanks to my wife said the year old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases About week ago was going about four or five days in row on about three hours of sleep which is completely crazy cause then ll be going on fumes The last couple of nights ve gotten five hours sleep so feel much better He said he misses the endorphins of power walking and he is wracked when he gets home at midnight and it too late to answer calls and emails gotta get rid of this guilt feeling he murmured about that moment emails He said he has not been tested for the coronavirus but takes his temperature every day and usually has it taken another couple times before White House press conferences and meetings in the Oval When spoke with him he had been missing from the White House briefing for two days and Twitter blew gasket with everyone from Susan Rice to Laurence Tribe seeking an answer to the urgent query Where is Dr Fauci Donald Trump the ultimate me guy is in we crisis and it isn pretty The president is so consumed by his desire to get back his binky soaring stock market that he continues to taffy twist the facts leaving us to look elsewhere to Dr Fauci and governors like Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom for leadership during this grim odyssey Dr Fauci chuckled at speculation that he was banished due to his habit of pushing back on Trump hyperbolic and self serving ad libbing That kind of funny but understandable that people said What the hell the matter with Fauci because had been walking fine line ve been telling the president things he doesn want to hear he said have publicly had to say something different with what he states It a risky business But that my style Maureen You know me for many years say it the way it is and if he gonna get pissed off he gonna get pissed off Thankfully he is not Interestingly The first time talked to Dr Fauci was during panic in the mid about stopping another virus the cause of the heartbreaking AIDs crisis Then as now he was honest brave and innovative He told me that he tries to be diplomatic when he has to contradict the president about what game changer cures might be on the horizon and whether everyone who wants to be tested can get tested don want to embarrass him the immunologist says in his gravelly Brooklyn accent don want to act like tough guy like stood up to the president just want to get the facts out And instead of saying You re wrong all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is And he gets that He a smart guy He not dummy So he doesn take it certainly up to now he doesn take it in way that m confronting him in any way He takes it in good way On Friday trigger happy Trump was so quick to talk up the fabulous possibilities of an antimalarial drug in combating the virus that Dr Fauci had to pump the brakes taking the microphone to explain that we do not know yet because controlled testing is needed The president returned to the lectern to press his unscientific case and compliment himself m smart guy he said feel good about it And we re going to see You re going to see soon enough Probably thinking about all his government staffers working round the clock Dr Fauci could not help rubbing his forehead and cheek going against his own advice to the public when Trump cracked joke about the Deep State Department Though the scientist listens respectfully when the president and the vice president are talking he somehow manages to emit an Oh my God please don say that vibe when the two men scamper over the line When Mike Pence went into false hope overdrive saying just can emphasize enough about the incredible progress that we have made on testing Dr Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx the administration virus response coordinator exchanged whispered aside that sent the internet into frenzy Dr Fauci assured me that despite their crosscurrents and an early overconfidence about how easy it would be to control the path of the virus the president absolutely now gets the threat of the invisible enemy as Trump calls the virus Still Trump managed to have an hourlong press conference about public health guidance in which he relentlessly ran afoul of public health guidance He wants to think of himself as wartime president but he can rise above his pettiness and defensiveness long enough to stop trashing White House reporters who are simply trying to do their job under perilous circumstances He also can move away from his old standby xenophobia Trump has never understood anything about government so he doesn know what the D versus the D versus FEMA should do His improvisational leadership style was vividly and disturbingly on display Friday during call with Chuck Schumer who urged him to invoke the Defense Production Act to get ventilators and masks to desperate states despite the president cavalier remark day earlier that the federal government is not shipping clerk for the states Then POTUS yelled to someone in his office to do it now Schumer spokesman reported Trump is just petrified salesman who believes in perception over reality He thinks if he can create the perception that this is going to be quick fix and there a little pill coming then the stock market will roar back along with his momentum With D and the Great Depression the only thing to fear was fear itself With Trump and our new abyss we have to fear not only fear but also the ignorance and misdirection of the White House and the profiteering of senators

fl5ev8p,i will give you guys an idea what extent the Chinese went with their lock down especially in Wuhan to successfully contain this virus amp B Each community would have its own whatsapp group wechat every member of that group need to report body temperature taken daily this is for the whole country Any symptoms at all need to be reported For any unit that has ppl tested positive they would have those giant yellow biohazard tapep across that unit door like in the movies and they would announce in the whatsapp group and alert everyone clearly all public space transportation is shut City to city border will be blocked so no one is allowed to travel at all For apartment building with multiple entrance point all others except the main one will be sealed shut There is at least one patrolman guarding each apartment Anyone going in and out need to show their paper permit on why they need to head out the reason for this to not only to contain the viruse but also deter looting stealing as all business are shut and left unguarded You basically can drive unless it for some serious grocery haul Some apartment just shut their garage door during the entire lock down For any person taking stroll randomly or go on the street without permit large fine even arrest If you run you get tazed bcs they think you might be out looting For most cities the entrance to highway is blocked you can get out the city at all unless you walk the whole way provided you don get stop mid way For anyone that suspected carrying the disease E leaving wuhan before the city shutdown they will track you down and everyone you been in contact with on your way mandatory quarantine And finally people just take this incredibly seriously family would not meet one another during the lock down it not unusual for family member all staying at separate hotel rooms so they don cross infect one another if one of their test come back positive Clearly some of these are quite drastic but just keep in mind the mentality in the society is that people are in this together not brewing rebellion So even measures are kind of over the top but the patrolman police enforcing it do it with genuine care for the community Ppl have strong belief that they can get out of these together and everyone is doing their part this is important as see some citizens behavior in other countries current lock down can only be described as irresponsible amp B For treatment amp B They built tons of make shift containment center so for anyone that mildly sick you get put in there and loaded up on antiviral drugs one nurse can take care of up to patients so it saves hospital beds for ppl who need more urgent care They also built couple hospitals but only in Wuhan as the city healthcare system collapsed Bcs rest of the country was not as heavily affected there were something like healthcare workers sent to Wuhan later on to help out that K nurse and doctors most went voluntarily which is kind of nuts as that is more than the number of the patients but then again china quarantine anyone that being suspected carrying the virus in those containment center and most test end up negative It quite feat none of those are infected It helps they are all in full hazmat suit all the time edit by meant for the sent to wuhan when wuhan own healthercare system collapsed the doctors nurses indigenous to wuhan seen infection rate and some hospital at the early stage would have their entire staff team infected bcs they are not wearing masks and etc that was big problem as more patients are coming in and fewer staff available doctors were literally going non stop without sleep for full week ended up broken down staffs are heavy on xanax as hundreds of death pile up and then clearly medical supplies were being made countrywide in couple wks they made billions of face masks amp B Conclusion Wuhan certainly didn beat this epidemics by just its own resource the entire china helped and even to this point whilst the rest of the country has started to restore economic activity bit by bit wuhan is till under strict lock down No park or any sort of business is open No public transportation things will likely remain the same till early April So you could see what measures have been put in place and it start to make sense why the mortality and is substantially higher in almost anywhere else Now have been living in north america for almost decade and have lived in Europe and Australia before the few challenges see with implementing some of the measures in western countries are amp B ppl would likely not willing to share their travel history and even if they do travel history and contact history are private information thus wouldn be openly shared with the neighborhood So it impossible to know if your neighborhood is safe or has the virus has been transmitting inside ppl would argue total lock down is violation of their freedom human rights and etc for its own merit so true real Marshall law style lock down is likely not on the table China implement very stringent lock down so after one month they would see new case and people can get back to their life half ass lockdown wouldn stop transmitting it would just slow it so it will take almost forever to see new cases and that defeats the whole purpose of the lock down If there is still active undetected cases out there then soon as ppl get back to their normal life the outbreak would worsen instantly don know why this is hard to understand You need true new cases for the lockdown to make sense Anything less than that it a waste of time and resource Media has been downplaying the danger or just use China number to model their projection but totally disregard the measures that were put in place Also important to know that the Chinese manage to identify every single person carrying the virus even those one show very little symptoms and the mortality rate is based on that The mortality rate for flu is at is because most of the cases are simply not detected had you detect all the flu cases the real mortality rate is likely in hundred thousands or something like along that line That also the problem with much higher mortality rate in Italy and soon in rest of EU plus US which is there are not enough ppl being tested if you are only testing the ones that are already in the hospital then you are really just testing the that are in condition that need to be hospitalized and then of course the mortality rate among those group would be substantially higher Remember for person tested positive will need hospitalization and will need intensive care and unfortunately the mortality rate is also out of the However what happening right now is you are only testing that person so you will be looking at mortality rate of about which would be around and think we will likely see that as mortality rate in Italy keep climbing higher Finally is that Wuhan has the entire china behind supporting it which is world second largest economy with the largest manufacturing power and plenty of medical personnel reserve countries like Italy don have that support system when things start to collapse they can reply on backup for help So the best is to be as prepared as possible bcs everyone got their hands full if your healthcare system collapse that pretty much game over amp B The sooner the world start to learn and realize this the sooner we can have this thing under control Good luck everyone and stay safe ,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

took the one statement that made directly criticizing the sycophancy of his cult rather than commenting on any of the actual points made FWIW that was mostly test to see if you were actually concerned about the coronavirus or concerned about the image of the president You failed gt Trumps false claims about the coronavirus is just liberal talking point Trump said to treat it like the flu not that it is the flu He said the same things the CDC has recommended which is wash hands cover cough and sneeze avoid others who are sick stay home if sick Donald Trump has repeatedly made false statements despite having received accurate information from experts https www nbcnews com politics donald trump just my hunch trump contradicts health experts coronavirus gt Experts say the death rate is percent Trump says that false gt Trump says vaccine is coming soon Experts say not so fast gt Experts predict more cases Trump says S cases are going very substantially down gt Trump says coronavirus is like flu Experts say it multiple times worse gt Trump says it OK to go to work when sick Experts say do not go to work gt Trump says warm weather could kill the virus Experts say that premature This is disinformation is it not Our president is trusting his gut rather than experts and every time he spreads this disinformation it makes it more difficult to come back that false information that came from him with accurate information that comes from scientists gt What are your suggestions to help contain the virus Which country can you point to and say they have contained the virus successfully and prevented deaths effectively Right now the best we have is what ve said above in the previous paragraph Without knowing what this thing does we should be all trying not to panic and being extra cautious and if possible proactive One suggestion is adequate communication from the CDC The Kirkland Retirement Facility outbreak was exacerbated by lack of information And now we are seeing further spread in the Pacific Northwest and we still don have adequate testing and isolation procedures in place The administration is saying that the virus is contained and yet we don even know how widespread the outbreak in Washington is am not panicked about the Coronavirus am concerned that the apparent lack of concern for Public Health by the Trump Administration Without data being gathered and relayed to the public by the CDC we can even make decisions based on accurate information gt What don understand is what you want the government to do about this that you can do yourself If you believe that telling people to hunker down practice social distancing and prepare for the worst is going to produce the best results then there literally nothing stopping you from doing so or stopping you from going to the streets with bullhorn protesting making blog posts anything you want to do Hurr durr you just want the government to protect you from things What ridiculous straw man dude Anyway go ahead and read the Constitution One of the reasons for it writing was to promote the general welfare One of their jobs is to act in times of potential crisis Are you really suggesting that going to the streets with bullhorn protesting making blog post anything you want to do is real solution That just spreads disinformation by having multiple people without adequate data spreading their hunches about the disease in the same way that Donald Trump is currently doing from his position in the White House We need accurate information coming from the CDC not some Nutjob with bullhorn and an Alex Jones conspiracy theory gt The problem with liberal types is that in time of crisis they look to the government to save them and often times they can I not politicizing this more than anyone else agree coming together without political motive would be best but psychologists from Harvard have indicated that in times of pandemic one of the first things people do is find something someone to direct their anger at For many that has become the Trump administration Once again nice straw man am not expecting the government to save me expect them to take the proper steps to inform the public about the Coronavirus and provide data about the spread as well as help communities that have been exposed to the Coronavirus to take proper precautions As far as the lashing out goes go fuck yourself The president son said that Liberals are hoping for people to die from virus The president has called it Democrat hoax If you are still saying that this should be bipartisan effort then you and other Republicans should be criticizing Donald Trump his son and anybody else who has been suggesting this be anything other than bipartisan effort While am incredibly critical of Donald Trump for his many flaws in the case of the coronavirus I ve been trying to approach his response to the coronavirus from position of bipartisanship but the disinformation campaigns of his administration and the partisan attacks from himself his son and his most Ardent supporters is making this incredibly difficult Anyway hope you understand after all of my frustrated ramble that am more concerned about the Public Health crisis than the partisan political optics and would like to stop discussing the partisan rhetoric and move on with the conversation to the bipartisan solution

fj62jcy,Yeah but there are some exceptions to that rule of synergy It admittedly loose theory but you never know Somehow though have the purely gut feeling that the flu amp coronavirus combined are not acclimated to each other synergistically and that the two combined may at least not be any worse than the coronavirus alone If so then possibly they will fight it out My other loose theory is that ingested capsaicin the active heat compound found in hot chili peppers will neutralize COVID in the gut based on an as yet undetermined chemical synthesis taking place in the gut The human gut is chemistry lab in its own right like no other and the scope of chemical processes occurring therein including being representative of and synergistic to other unique chemical functions attributed to the brain are still FAR from being fully understood So why not ve always eaten lot of hot peppers anyway just because enjoy them but there are lot of seemingly profound health benefits found with ingesting capsaicin that again are not well understood And the least of which may be that capsaicin does have proven antimicrobial properties Otherwise regular ingestion of capsaicin appears to strengthen the immune system contributes to both healthier digestive amp vascular system as well to be presumed curative for different forms of cancer There are published NIH GOV clinical trial studies using capsaicin in the treatment of skin cancer specifically that you can find online Those studies showed definite promise The thing believe to be true though is that EVEN IF capsaicin can or would cure all sorts of different diseases then you can bet that cancer doctors amp drug companies alike will NOT be receptive of the idea because if true then it would threaten their business model of selling radiation treatment chemotherapy and all manner of ridiculously expensive drugs Even if proven beyond reasonable doubt that capsaicin can or would cure all sorts of different maladies possibly even COVID then you WILL NOT see the CDC the NIH or WHO advertising any of that information They won do it promise But in addition to my typical daily diet of eating hot peppers also bought several bottles of cayenne pepper capsules through Amazon and am eating one day of those for an added Heat Units on the Scoville Scale The benefit to the capsules is that the capsaicin bypasses the taste buds and goes straight to the gut personally like the burning sensation in my mouth as well as other physiological effects produced from eating hot peppers such as with producing cold sweat on the forehead neck amp scalp They have also always tended to give me runny nose which just means usually have to blow my nose after eating handful of Jalapenos or other hot peppers don especially care for the anal effects of capsaicin when taking poop which causes mild burning sensation but m used to the effect don recommend overdoing it with ingesting too much capsaicin at all You can sure overdo it Don use products like Mad Dog hot sauce which is Heat Units on the Scoville Scale There are also products around boasting to million Heat Units Stay away from those Pure capsaicin is at million Heat Units and million isn far behind the purest form These products are manufactured from boiled down concentrations of among the hottest pepper varieties in the world such as the Carolina Reaper amp Ghost Pepper varieties will use some of these ultra fiery peppers very sparingly in slow cooker recipes like chili con carne but never eat the stuff straight When it comes to eating straight hot peppers stick mostly to Jalapenos and the Mezzetta brand of hot chili pepper which is hybrid variety produced amp grown exclusively by the Mezzetta family also eat wax peppers Maybe capsaicin will prevent and or cure coronavirus don know It occurs to me it might work But right now anyway there is not only no proof to say m wrong but there are also NO BETTER suggestions going around as you know other than to wash your hands and wear face mask eat LOT of capsaicin and rarely get sick even being around sick people go for years at stretch without getting sick at all and even when do never get sick enough to become bedridden also don get flu shots and never had my tonsils removed ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

emerged reported confirmed new infections on Tuesday the lowest such total since January as the infections there continued to dwindle But the epidemic showed little signs of waning elsewhere Iran remained source of concern in the Middle East with nearby Bahrain and Kuwait reporting dozens of new cases tied to the Iranian outbreak Tehran has confirmed more than cases but public health experts have expressed concern that the authorities are understating the true breadth of the epidemic there Just three weeks ago South Korea had only handful of cases Now there are nearly demonstrating how quickly the virus can spread And officials in Italy saw the number of new cases push past on Tuesday even as the government sought to restore some sense of normality in Milan the city closest to the hardest hit areas in the country north Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter Museums in Milan were permitted to reopen but visitors were asked to stand

fgachcb,no no no and they also put out public statement that they were sorry that social media was reading this as that people created this do your self favor and write to bkundu at bioschool iitd ac in he will send you standart disclaimer If you dont understand this then dont jump to conclusions Let me try to explain the whole HIV thing has been debunked This has been debunked Dr Konermann of Stanford just checked their results The similarity is spurious Out of inserts they identify between NCov and SARS are found in bat coronavirus Of the remaining two only one is most similar to HIV and is so short AA that the similarity is not higher than chance given database In fact the Bat SARS Like CoV discovered in contains all the four insertions Insertion and of nCoV are identical to Bat SARS Like CoV Insertion involves two synonymous and one Thr Ile mutation Insertion contains one synonymous mutation and bp insertion Therefore the two viruses have very high sequence similarity and are likely evolutionarily related naturally Indeed the four identified insertions are the result of the pair wise comparison of Wuhan nCoV and SARS virus Fig and are an artifact when comparing only two viruses the alignment of the spike protein of the novel Coronavirus protein ID QHD with the bat spike protein mentioned by Jason Weir shows very high conservation see attached image particularly also in regards to the claimed inserts in Figure of the preprint This makes the bat Coronavirus much more likely origin than the proposed connection to HIV performed an alignment of these sequences and indeed found that these insertions mentioned in the preprint are real However blasted each of these insertions to the non redundant protein database and found over hits for every single of these insertions The hits are others coronaviruses plants parasites bacteria This indicates the hits to HIV seems fortuitous and the evolutionary link between nCoV and HIV is to me not ascertained Additionally the authors in the manuscripts did not provide e value for their findings nor they have explained in their methodology why they restricted their search for viral genomes only and not others organisms Therefore would argue that the results presented do not appear uncanny to me based on flawed methodology Therefore the results presented in this paper should be taken very cautiously All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms not just HIV In other words the primary finding of this work are entirely highly expected coincidence In short the authors base their analysis on short sequence of the spike protein from nCoV but much more comprehensive search outside for the viral sequences queried in the manuscript demonstrates that this sequence is also found in many many other places than HIV Thus while the nCoV strain does appear to have sequence difference from other closely related viruses there is not enough resolution to clearly demonstrate the evolutionary history of this change let alone trace it to HIV blasted each of the four nCoV inserts shown in Table and received identity with number of other hits other than HIV For example BLAST results for insert RSYLTPGDSSSG received identity with Spike glycoprotein from bat coronovirus with Genbank accession number GenBank QHR It is thus much closer to known bat coronovirus than it is to HIV Likewise each of the other three inserts have amino acid identity to other non HIV sources The paper is thus highly misleading in that it does not discuss the other blast hits to non HIV related sources some of which have high identity than those from HIV The implications of the paper that nCoV coronovirus has elements of HIV virus inserted into it should be treated with scepticism ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

fl2emo5,Well if you want the opinion of garbage man have an opinion on this as well as some things think companies should do to make sure things continue to run First dont blame people for being afraid either but the fear is mostly overblown in regards to waste workers We spend all day either alone or with one other person who in turn spends most of the day on the back of truck Very much socially isolated Coming in contact with waste that has the virus on it is possibility but everything ve read said you have to have some active viruses somehow make it into your nose mouth or eyes Your average garbage man is not going to touch his mouth nose or eyes without sanitizing first because dog shit and rotten meat generally isnt stuff you want on any of your wet bits anyway We are required to wear gloves which is where the virus will be anyway so you take your gloves off sanitize your hands d imagine the risk of infection from corona drastically drops off Not to mention garbage is usually sitting on the curb for hours before being picked up Coronavirus has been shown to live quite long time outside in laboratory conditions but being outside exposed to the elements is not exactly lab conditions Some virus may be still alive but much of it is probably going to die off due to heap of garbage not being conducive to viruses of this type as far as can tell Bacteria loves the shit though all they need is air water and something to eat m not saying there no risk just saying the risk is low compared to someone in temperature controlled grocery store closely interacting with people all day and touching things that half dozen other people have touched in the past hours dont know if d call it low risk but my intuition tells me its lower risk when compared to other jobs deemed essential perhaps in the bottom of those where employees have to still come to work every day cant think of an example of less flu virus transmission prone job that still employs ton of people but m sure there must be some it just much easier to think of ton of them that are higher risk So my opinion is these guys should probably make an effort to go to work and keep their hands clean which they should be doing anyway cuz das nasty How to alleviate some of the problems Extend the Hours of Service exemptions to waste drivers to allow the people who want to come to work during this pandemic to work longer hours m fine working hour shifts to make up for those who dont want to come to work hour shifts are common anyway and could use the overtime Temporarily suspend bulk pickups Couches and mattresses and shit take up lot of room on the truck and force more trips to the landfill over the course of work day Suspend weight restrictions for garbage trucks and allow mechanics to adjust hydraulic pressure to allow packing more trash onto the truck It not great for roads or the equipment might even have few hydraulic fluid disasters but more trash on the truck means less trips to the landfill trip to the landfill and back to route can take two hours trucks saving trip to the landfill every day means extra man hours of actual work per site Suspend noise ordinances for residential areas Let us come pick up trash at am so we dont have to fight traffic and pedestrians and dodge kids all day Allow garbage men to refuse trash that is not bagged Saves you from potentially coming in contact with like used tissues or moist ass wipes It be popular rule even without pandemic going on Just my opinions here The situation sucks but inform everyone of the risks and realities of the situation and loosen some regulations that reduce efficiency while there a labor shortage and feel like the situation can be much more manageable ,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

fkfy97y,Copy and pasting the Facebook Post from WCPSS gt March COVID Update gt As of March all Wake County Schools will continue to operate on the regular schedule with the following exceptions gt School Extracurricular Activities and Events ALL extracurricular activities and events are suspended indefinitely beginning at m on Sunday March This includes any school based events happening before or after school hours gt All school based before and after school child care programs will operate on normal schedule gt Athletic Activities gt The North Carolina High School Athletic Association NCHSAA has suspended interscholastic athletics beginning at m on Friday March through Monday April NCHSAA will decide before April whether to suspend activities beyond that date We are following the same guidelines for middle school athletics All workouts skill development practices and contests are suspended for middle and high school gt This means that there will be no practices or games for any middle and high school athletic teams gt This weekend Men and Women Basketball State Championships also have been postponed gt District Events gt District sponsored events that include the general public have been canceled indefinitely as of Monday March gt District sponsored meetings that require school staff to leave campus have been canceled indefinitely gt District sponsored in person district professional development has been canceled School sponsored professional development taking place on school campus is not affected gt As of today school board meetings will be held as scheduled The meeting format will be determined If meetings are held in person we will stream all work sessions and board meetings so that the public may attend virtually gt Board of Education Spotlight on Student celebrations are suspended until further notice The current decision to operate our schools on normal schedule during the COVID pandemic is based on current data that our children have not been identified as high risk population for COVID In addition most of our workforce is also not identified as high risk Following recommendations of CDC closing for short period of time could do more harm than good That said this unprecedented situation requires maximum flexibility We know that we have some students and staff who are at high risk or who live with someone who is at high risk gt For this reason we will operate under the maximum flexibility available under the current law Students absences Principals will use maximum flexibility when excusing absences during this time Senior Exam Exemptions Absences will not be considered when determining senior exemptions For exams created by the school exemptions will be based only on grades of B or Unless directed otherwise by the state students will be required to participate in all end of course EOC assessments administered by the State Department of Public Instruction gt Staff attendance To help ensure student and staff safety employees know that they are not obligated to report to work if they feel that they are not well or if they are in high risk category gt We are doing this because we understand that the public school system plays vital role in our community far beyond our core purpose of teaching and learning We understand that keeping the public school system open is critical for the health and safety of our community In making this decision we are considering the following gt Thousands of health and medical professionals children attend our schools Closing schools compromises the ability of many of them to work at our hospitals clinics and other medical facilities at time when their presence is crucial gt Thousands of public safety professionals children attend our schools Closing schools compromises the ability of many of them to work in Emergency Management Centers EMS law enforcement fire departments and other emergency response positions impacting the core safety of our community gt Possibly increased risk of exposure When schools close children have to go somewhere This often includes children being left with caregivers who might be elderly or who are at risk This increases risk of exposure between and among children and older or at risk adults rather than having students spend the day with children their own age and with adults who are at lower risk gt Childcare Closing schools for an extended period of time has negative impact on many parents ability to work and in many cases could compromise their jobs and the overall economy of our community gt Food insecurity is an issue among many of our students When schools are closed for extended periods many of our students do not have access to healthy food This could aggravate an already volatile situation gt While we are not making the decision to close at this time families should prepare for this possibility According to the CDC school district would need to remain closed for at least or more weeks to help control the spread of COVID If an individual school or the district does not have enough staff to supervise students we will be required to close We understand that this situation is also unprecedented as the outcome for our community would be significant both for our families and for staff We ask parents and staff to prepare now for possible closure We understand that the economic health safety and educational implications would be significant gt This is an unprecedented situation and one for which we do not have all the answers We acknowledge the anxiety this may cause We are working through all the implications and will share information as we make decisions We must also acknowledge that many of these decisions are not in our power to make and will need to be made in partnership with state and federal agencies For students and staff who will be attending school it is critical that you follow the advice of health professionals gt Do not attend school if you are sick To promote public safety we ask all students parents and staff to take your temperature prior to attending school The CDC directs you to stay home if you have temperature of or higher or are experiencing flu like symptoms gt Prioritize hand washing Hand washing with soap and water for at least seconds is the most effective way to contain the spread of illness and disease including COVID gt Avoid visiting high risk populations For everyone safety local health officials are asking people to take advantage of technology such as video calling instead of making visit in person gt At this time no student or staff member has tested positive for COVID We are prepared to respond quickly if school is impacted directly by COVID because either staff member or student tests presumptive positive We are certain that if this situation occurs we ll be notified immediately by public health officials In turn we ll immediately notify the staff and families of that school community We anticipate that in this situation we will close the affected school for minimum of two days to clean the school conduct health investigation and notify any affected students or staff gt Wake County Emergency Management is the lead agency in our community COVID response Our partnership is critical in keeping our schools and community safe We are working very closely with these and other health professionals as we consider our decisions gt Wake County Public Health has developed FAQ list to answer many questions concerning safety issues around COVID As we continue to communicate with Wake

fidjhei,I mentioned this the other day but ll mention it again to counter any misinformation was quarantined on Wednesday night Mostly m asymptomatic by which mean have cold self reported to immigration at Busan Airport because the virus had taken so long to break around days if you check my very recent past history break down the symptoms and their onset over the course of three weeks Once they decided was potential risk was quarantined and an ambulance was called About an hour later the ambulance turned up and was met by guy in full hazmat gear He took me out of the airport back door fastest route out with least interaction with the public We then rode to Busan University hospital asked him about the situation this was just as Daegu was breaking he told me there were or so cases and over people had been tested thought he was misunderstanding so stressed no not China Korea and he confirmed this mention this because the official number above on seems incorrect Or he was misinformed either way it showed that Korea was taking cautionary and preventative measures already We arrived at the hospital about minutes later and waited The ambulance pulled right up to side entrance with clearly marked DANGER tape locking it off from the general public Again shit is getting taken very seriously After the nurses were ready and in their full hazmat gears we entered the hospital The floor had clear markers and tape dividing the corridor It was clearly explained which side of the tape had to walk along Obviously was not to touch anything Every step was shadowed by the two nurses on call to make sure didnt screw up We arrived on the floor wasnt paying attention but assume it was the top floor and finally entered my room For people who work in hospitals this is probably all common but for me who never been in sterile wing it was definitely isolated Obviously everyone who attended was in full hazmat gear as had my tests and ray ray machine was wiped down at all joints Upon leaving the room and into the cant think of the word the containment room the staff went through step by step process of disinfecting and left was then alone and communicated via intercom while the test results were processed About hours later was given the all clear nurse came to remove everything id used pyjamas etc all haz bins were emptied sheets and bedding changed pretty much full clean up then went through the steps that every member of staff has to go through to leave the ward Full hazmat suit staying on the opposite side of the corridor arrived in moving into second containment area and then tortuous step by step removal of my hazmat gear It was or so very careful steps of removing articles of the suit washing hands even had to put on second set of gloved in the middle of it only to remove them after couple more steps In that one period must have disinfected my hands about or times Finally finished the process stepped into small disinfectant tray for my shoes and entered the safe zone The safe zone had ZERO patients It was nurses and doctor on call Im not sure if this is normal but it was the graveyard shift But although there were beds no one had made them and the one chart saw by the bed looked like it been there for fair while Clearly this wasnt functioning ward it may come into use in high stress periods but outside this it object seems to be to move patients from isolation into the normal system without having them fully contact the general hospital population Anyways thats my quarantine process It was incredibly professional structured and organised Every step was meticulous and carefully planned And once inside quarantine contact was minimised as much as possible The point is Korea clearly isnt messing around or being in any way complacent about the situation My hat genuinely goes off to them and the staff who were so unbelievably professional ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

fhqwmcs,https www telegraph co uk news exclusive millions told stay home coronavirus continues spread Anyone suffering flu like symptoms could be ordered to self isolate for fortnight if the number of coronavirus cases in the UK hits the hundreds in what would be dramatic shift in Government strategy Over the last week hospitals across the country have created isolation pods to ensure that anyone tested for the virus is kept away from other patients with efforts to track all close contacts of confirmed cases But The Telegraph understands that after series of high level meetings health officials are expected to change tack and simply order anyone with possible symptoms of flu to stay at home if the virus is not contained That means millions of Britons with coughs and colds could end up quarantined at home as part of attempts to dampen down spread of the virus It comes as Chinese tourist visiting France became the first person to die of coronavirus in Europe and another GP surgery was shut in England Eight out of the nine people in Britain to have contracted the virus to date have now recovered and left hospital following treatment The five members of ski group infected by Steve Walsh the businessman at the centre of the UK outbreak have said they had recovered quickly Advertisement Writing in The Sunday Telegraph Dominic Raab the Foreign Secretary today called for more international cooperation to prevent Coronavirus turning into global pandemic The Telegraph understands that senior managers have been told that the NHS could stop testing patients once around cases have been confirmed across the country if there is evidence of sustained transmission within the UK The WHO advises countries to carry out detailed investigation of at least the first confirmed cases of any pandemic Britain Pandemic Influenza Response Plan sets out protocols for ensuring isolation and treatment for the first few cases so that detailed information can be gathered about any novel virus But it says the approach should be changed as soon as there is evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus ie cases not linked to any known or previously identified cases The health service is already struggling to cope with the number of tests for the virus it is carrying out In the last week the number tested has quadrupled with now carried out up from week ago The NHS has the capacity to carry out tests day but on Thursday alone it carried out tests Advertisement Prof Chris Whitty England chief medical officer has said the current approach aims to contain and delay the spread of the virus as much as possible in order to buy time while treatments and vaccines are researched But if there are cases of onward transmission in this country and it becomes sustained the strategy will shift to mitigation as the NHS would not be able to cope with vast numbers of patients undergoing tests If large numbers fall ill but suffer mild symptoms sending them to hospital when isolation could not be maintained would increase the risk of spreading the disease among the vulnerable The Foreign Secretary said the British government is helping the World Health Organisation to train rapid response teams and local emergency medics in Asia and Africa to fight the virus and has donated million to the WHO Flash Appeal to stop its spread Experts say if the situation becomes pandemic percent of the population could get the virus and up to people might die However officials stress that it is still possible that the UK could avoid sustained transmission One NHS manager in London said services were struggling to cope with demand for tests with staff spending hours waiting to ensure those undergoing the checks remained in isolation with ambulances used to ferry them home She said hospitals were overwhelmed by demand to keep up with tests with nurses being warned that they may have to test people in their homes in future On Thursday the head of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens warned that many more people may be forced to self isolate as part of efforts to stop Coronavirus spreading in Britain Prof Neil Ferguson professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College has warned that the world is in the early phases of global pandemic Health worker deep cleaning the Ritchie Street Health Centre in Islington following its closure due to suspected case of Coronavirus He said Britain is probably only picking up around one in three cases focusing on those coming in to the country when cases may have arrived and gone undetected before restrictions set in Surveillance has started in hospitals across the UK of pneumonia cases that will give us proper picture he said Our best estimate is that transmission in the UK will get going in the next few weeks unless we are very lucky probably peaking to months after that he said If it truly establishes itself in terms of true person to person transmission it will behave like flu pandemic maybe up to percent of the population being affected but most of those people having very mild symptoms He suggested that people in the UK could die from it in the next months based on estimates of per cent mortality rate and an infection rate of percent of the population The year old Chinese man who died from the virus in France flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on January but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid Coronavirus The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat Claude Bernard hospital northern Paris His daughter is also in hospital but French authorities say she is likely to make good recovery In Portsmouth the Kingston Crescent Surgery became the latest to shut for deep cleaning until further notice on Friday after woman suspected to have the virus walked in after falling ill The woman is said to have felt unwell some time after arriving in Britain at Gatwick Airport The closure is the latest to hit string of surgeries and health centres around the country including Islington in north London and Taunton in Somerset after being attended by patients with suspected Coronavirus At the same time the last of those quarantined at Arrowe Park in the Wirral after returning from China have now been allowed home Mr Walsh year old Scout leader from Hove in East Sussex contracted Coronavirus on business trip to Singapore and on his way back stopped off at ski resort in France where five other Britons were subsequently infected In statement the group who were treated at the Royal Free Hospital and St Thomas Hospital in London said All of our group including the six in other countries have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation We understand the virus can be dangerous for some but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people Health Secretary Matt Hancock said am pleased that of the individuals who tested positive for Coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital Again this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan Coronavirus want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public ,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

on the tongue will ward off the coronavirus spreading across Asia and the world In Indonesia Terawan Agus Putranto the health minister advised citizens to relax and eschew overtime work to avoid the disease which has killed more than people and infected more than others mostly in China To prevent it is very easy as long as your immunity is good Mr Terawan said And in Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen told packed news conference on Thursday that he would kick out anyone who was wearing surgical mask because such measures were creating an unwarranted climate of fear The prime minister doesn wear mask he said so why do you The World Health Organization has declared the epidemic which appears to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan global health emergency But the message does not seem to be resonating in some parts of Southeast Asia magnet for Chinese tourists and workers The region now has the largest cluster of coronavirus patients outside China Some governments there have either played down the threat of the epidemic or openly worried about offending superpower whose economic heft can propel their economies Medical experts worry that delayed response could hasten the spread of the disease Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the H s director general On Sunday the first overseas death from the virus of year old Wuhan resident who had died day earlier was reported in the Philippines The virus has spread to about two dozen countries Hours before the death was announced President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines ordered temporary entry ban on most travelers who had recently been in mainland China Hong Kong and Macau Earlier in the week Mr Duterte who has brought the Philippines closer to China while distancing it from the United States said there was no reason to bar visitors from mainland China bringing barrage of criticism from local medical experts We are not as prepared as first world countries said Anthony Leachon Philippine health advocate who had urged temporary entry ban even if it risked riling Beijing Countries should break protocols to save their people With confirmed cases Thailand has the most cases in Southeast Asia followed by Singapore with Japan with confirmed cases has the second largest number outside China Thailand announced on Friday that Thai taxi driver had tested positive for coronavirus most likely after coming into contact with Chinese traveler Yet even as the threat of human to human transmission grows the country health officials have counseled against undue concern One of the confirmed cases in Thailand involved Chinese man in the northern city of Chiang Mai who initially tested negative for the virus after being admitted to hospital and was therefore transferred out of an isolation unit to general ward said Rungrueng Kitphati spokesman for the country health ministry The chances of him spreading the disease is very low said Mr Rungrueng noting that the space between beds in the general ward was more than yard Our medical staff always wash their hands in and out It will not be communicable to others Yet in Wuhan the coronavirus has infected medical workers including doctor who had raised the alarm about the mysterious virus in December only to have the local government berate him for illegal behavior As the virus has spread across the region some governments have remained in denial At one hospital in Yangon the largest city in Myanmar slide show during presentation on preventing the spread of coronavirus said Don be so afraid of the coronavirus It won last long because made in China Health is not joke and the virus is not joke either said Aung Aung surgeon at Mandalay General Hospital don think Myanmar has the modern techniques to know whether the virus is here On Friday Myanmar announced its first suspected case involving Chinese man who had arrived by plane from Guangzhou Myanmar does not have the capacity to test for this specific coronavirus said Zaw Htay government spokesman Any samples will need to be sent to Thailand or Hong Kong which could take up to week Even high level officials have been trading in folk remedies After Facebook user in Myanmar wrote widely read tribute to onions as way to prevent transmission of the coronavirus the chief minister of Tanintharyi Division Myint Mg shared the post on his Facebook page The Chinese government has announced that people should consume and have on hand as many onions as they can the post read with no basis in fact Cambodia has only one confirmed case of the deadly virus involving Chinese national in the boomtown of Sihanoukville which has been remade by an influx of tens of thousands of Chinese workers About travelers from Wuhan have flown to Cambodia since the epidemic was announced last month according to Cambodian civil aviation authorities In country with limited media freedoms some Cambodians worry that the full scope of the virus potential impact is not being reported for political reasons The country health minister suggested that Cambodia hot and humid climate could ward off the coronavirus And China has been pressuring countries not to ban its travelers with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman calling an entry ban enacted by the United States not in keeping with the facts and not in keeping with friendship Mr Hun Sen the prime minister who has tethered his country close to China has said he will not ban flights from China Nor will he organize an effort to evacuate Cambodians from Wuhan as other nations have done he said because they have to continue staying there and joining with Chinese to fight this disease Is there any Cambodian or foreigner in Cambodia who has died of the disease the prime minister asked The real disease happening in Cambodia right now is the disease of fear It is not the coronavirus that occurs in China Wuhan city Indonesia where direct flights from Wuhan brought tourists to the holiday island of Bali has not confirmed any cases of coronavirus leading to concerns about lax monitoring of incoming passengers The virus has been found in Malaysia Singapore and Australia three much less populous countries around Indonesia Laos secretive socialist nation on the border with China has also not confirmed any cases even though large number of Chinese tourists and workers cycle through the country On Saturday residents of the remote Natuna islands in Indonesia on the southern shores of the South China Sea gathered by the hundreds to protest decision to quarantine about Indonesians airlifted there from Wuhan People are upset said Andes Putra the head of Natuna Parliament noting that local officials had been given scant information about the virus Like other countries in Southeast Asia Indonesia depends heavily on Chinese tourism On Thursday alone Chinese tourists canceled their trips to Bali according to one industry association But on Sunday Indonesia said it was temporarily barring visitors from mainland China who had been there for days Mr Terawan the health minister has suggested that the coronavirus will not affect people who exercise properly and sleep amply Don fret he said Just enjoy and eat enough In Thailand where normally bustling airports have been emptied of holidaymakers and tourism officials say that arrivals from China could drop by percent in the first four months of this year Anutin Charnvirakul the public health minister recommended temporarily revoking the country visa on arrival program for mainland Chinese travelers But more than Chinese tourists who had entered Thailand over the past two months remain in the country according to immigration officials Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha of Thailand called for Mr Anutin to check in with tourism officials before submitting formal proposal to the cabinet process that could take days

fk8fsjd, PART II Sherry who is this doctor So her name is Helen Chu Helen Hi Helen How are you doing m doing well how are you m well thanks She a physician and researcher in Washington state which is where the first case of Corona virus was detected in the US back in January and she and her colleagues see potential solution to this testing problem in their own work we had study in place that was set up for detection of respiratory viral illnesses in the community She specializes in studying how viruses pass from person to person within that same community and she and her colleagues have this big study where they re collecting all these samples from people who are sick and then testing them in the lab for flu and other respiratory viruses and through collecting hundreds and hundreds of samples every week They re trying to track the spread of viruses and she was in the middle of collecting samples when the corner virus arrives in Washington That is right So we have the infrastructure in place already essentially in the Seattle area to be able to detect early entry of virus into the city and then to to understand how it spreads and that sounds like it would make her very well positioned to do the same thing for the coronavirus Exactly She thought of that the state health officials knew about their project and they immediately thought about the potential of this project to help with this issue of testing And so what happens they make their own coronavirus test really fast and they re ready to go to help the state by the first week of February but there one hitch we had to go through regulatory clearance essentially we had to talk to CDC we have to talk to FDA they don have the approval to test and then give those results out for two reasons One is they re not clinical lab so they don have the the regulatory approval for that and number two is they ve just created this new coronavirus test which isn yet FDA approved we were at point where we could test thousands and thousands of samples at very high throughput but we didn know what to do when we found the positive So there good reason to have some of those regulations in place but they figured this is public health emergency and they feel like there gotta be some way around this bureaucratic red tape where they could at least screen these samples and get that information out to the public health authorities to confirm that test whatever it is but everybody felt they re hesitant about being able to provide results or to do the testing at all the CDC doesn seem to find way around it weeks go by and they re getting more and more frustrated and they re seeing the outbreak is growing in China and it spreading to other countries so we know you know there a potential for it to be an outbreak not just in China we ve had the information we have the data they re sitting in our lab where we could actually answer the question and that was frustrating that we could answer it we have the capacity to answer it but we couldn move forward things we didn know what to do They feel like they re sitting on goldmine and they feel like the virus very well could be out there After all there had been this case in Washington State more than month earlier and nobody had eyes on it nobody been doing surveillance in the community testing samples so they re getting more and more nervous Is there something we re not seeing because we re not really testing very widely So what do they end up doing just kind of keeping those samples on ice and doing nothing Well at first that what they did because they thought they could speak with these officials and find out some official workaround so that they wouldn be violating regulations and get in trouble Everyone wanted to be able to do this the proper way to go through CDC and state labs and have them have the high capacity to do the testing of all of these patients who who really needed diagnosis But it just couldn be done And then it gets to February mean the month is almost gone it more than month since that first case and they finally just said what we would do is move forward with with research testing only we re going to start using this unapproved coronavirus test that we have and that we believe is very reliable and start testing these samples Wow so they re just going for well they re just going for it and like technically they can test right but the issue is they can report the results So what we would do would just be to go ahead and test the samples for coronavirus but not to associate that with the information from the sample So the clinical information So they have plan to test for the coronavirus And if they find it That would mean that they re sitting on information that they re not supposed to have they re sitting on information that they re not supposed to communicate because of these regulatory issues that all going to be fine as long as they don find the case Okay so once they decide to do that What happened what happened was one of the very first days that they started testing February We got the first positive they found the case What thought was oh no if they came up that early in our testing that meant that it had probably been here for while and that we just didn know that it was there And so the questions racing through my head at that point were what is the right thing to do right now And so what happened at that point was that we rapidly convened meeting of the investigators the group just convenes they all get on the phone and they talk about ethics at this point we talk through the ethics of the different options keep it to ourselves how public health or tell the participants And what we were allowed to do was to keep it to ourselves but we felt like we needed to do was to tell public health So that what we did They decided that the most ethical thing is to report the result to the local health authority they confirm the result And it this local teenager in the very same County as that first positive case but no known link to that person and no travel history and that next morning the public health lab went out and they found this teenager who was feeling better by that point because he had mild form of this illness which is most common especially in young people and they get to him just after he walks into his school because yeah and they end up shutting the school down to make sure that nobody else will will catch the virus mean that was good moment for our team thought we did something that didn follow the rules but we were able to prevent spread in high school and that seemed really important too because of the doctor actions they kept him basically in the nick of time they do and they also realize that they may have big problem on their hands because if this case descended from that first case if that person potentially had infected somebody without knowing it and then you know there was mild illness going on and nobody caught it There could be hundreds of cases in the area And so that gave them the information that they needed to start acting to start looking more seriously for the virus in the community wonder have Dr Cheeto not broken the rules in this case how that would have changed how we understand the corona virus in the Seattle region Well we wouldn have known until the people started dying that there was problem And unfortunately the really sad thing is that that happened really soon after that And so if Dr Chu and her colleagues have been able to test sooner they would have been able to alert the authorities earlier And that the real tragedy here You know Sherry On the one hand the story that you just told it a pretty heroic story of doctor willing to go against the rules instructions because he felt that it was needed in the moment in the midst of public health crisis On the other hand it feels risky for the lesson here to be that medical professionals should go rogue in the middle of crisis mean what in your mind is the lesson here mean m somebody who reported on disasters for many years and used to do some disaster response myself and ve always seen in crises that thinking outside the box can really solve problems and it can save lives and think we generally accept that already that the rules do have to bend that people need to think creatively and one of the reasons they have to do it and it was so evident here was that the larger system the official responders the official system in place Couldn do everything and was faltering But wonder how much would things potentially have been different Sherry If thinking back to the start of our conversation Those government programs the National Security Council health program for example haven been cut And how much does that reflect an overall approach to this epidemic from the people currently in charge from the Trump administration think you can trace it back further than that It is pattern that these programs when there a crisis they get really well funded and as soon as Ebola recedes into history we start cutting those parts of government you can look back after the anthrax attacks and and there was all this money that went into bioterrorism preparedness and Hospital Preparedness and then you look at the numbers and they go down over time This is reaction of humanity and society and government is to sort of like when it in the news and it fresh in our minds we invest in it and then we turn away ,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

fk2cznf,MILAN You glance at the headlines just before going to bed on Saturday evening to discover your town has been put in lockdown Or is about to be It not clear Apparently the order hasn been signed yet Social media shows people rushing to the station mainly for the last trains south This is Milan economic dynamo of Italy the only city in the country that has grown stronger and richer through the long years of stagnation since the financial crisis of An enormous number of people who work here are from the south If the city is shutting down for the coronavirus they want to be home On Sunday morning my partner and eat breakfast listening to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte addressing the nation recording made in the small hours It was utterly irresponsible he tells us for someone to leak rough draft of the order before it had been finalized It caused immense confusion Still the fact remains that million people in northern Italy are now in lockdown and we re among them But thousands of people have already left very likely taking the virus with them The governors of the southern regions of Calabria Campania and Puglia are furious and announce that these arrivals will face restrictions That the kind of world we re in now In just two weeks all the usual certainties have gone It been spiritual exercise in letting go You paid for season ticket on the subway now you realize subway travel is the surest way of getting the disease You have subscription to the gym the gym is closed So is the cinema Your tickets for concerts and football games are useless Your children can go to school Or university Even mass is canceled What the mood Initially indignation Two weeks ago when the first restrictions came in banning all kinds of gatherings and closing pubs though not actually restricting our movement we were sure they overdone it cafe owner in downtown Milan told me angrily that one of the best weeks of the year had been blown carnival Fashion Week Hoteliers complained of percent cancellations Then we saw the number of infections shoot up hundred day Two hundred three hundred On Sunday in Lombardy alone On Saturday Antonio Pesenti the head of Lombardy intensive crisis care unit predicted that by March we will have sick people of whom will be needing assistance to breathe The places in intensive care in particular are under pressure The hospitals in Milan are already planning to move non coronavirus patients in intensive care to hospitals in other regions This is sobering Day by day there has been greater awareness of the need to keep your distance from people the importance of not shaking hands Suddenly the elevator stinks of disinfectant man opening door for you stands way back You realize the girl on the cash desk in the supermarket is wearing rubber gloves She apologizes when she sneezes and assures you it only sinus condition manager complains to boy at the deli counter that he should have said at once that his next door neighbor has tested positive Everybody is being asked to think not just for themselves but also for the community Milan is highly fragmented city There are all kinds of ethnic groups Chinese Arabs Hispanics Filipinos Indians any number of Romanians and Slavs Italians from every region Even the locals are quite sharply divided between working and middle classes And of course many of us communicate more online than on the street speaking to people like ourselves in other countries and continents But inevitably the virus is bringing new awareness that we all share the same physical space Milan Italy We really live here and we sink or swim together Perhaps we will even have to get to know each other albeit without shaking hands sense new spirit of unity The fallout for the economy will be huge But paradoxically the government is very likely to be strengthened The governing coalition is an association of two main parties the center left Democratic Party and the maverick Five Star Movement who disagree on so much that their only reason for staying in office together has been to avoid an election that would favor the right wing League party led by the authoritarian and xenophobic Matteo Salvini But now they have major issue that easy to agree on and that will give them chance to be united and decisive on behalf of the nation Support for Mr Salvini has begun to dwindle The government can also spend money The Stability and Growth Pact an agreement shared by all members of the European Union requires Italy to keep its deficit within strict parameters Even when every economic indicator would suggest the need to invest and spend as in the present prolonged period of near zero growth the government is obliged to beg Brussels for the right to introduce this or that incentive These requests are frequently denied and the politicians appear powerless But in an emergency as dramatic as this the government is in position to seize control The importance of the nation state is suddenly obvious Italians must decide for Italians Measures to spend billion euros around billion have been announced More probably much more is to follow Businesses are to be compensated parents with children of school age are to be given babysitting vouchers huge investment is being made to purchase medical equipment and increase hospital capacity One suspects that when God willing the emergency is over there will be those who will not want to relinquish this newfound power and the sense of identity and responsibility it brings For the moment though it us ordinary citizens who feel powerless Again and again the word fight is being used The metaphor of battle is deployed We must combat the virus Yet it turns out the best way to do so is to stay home which hardly feels like fighting All the same when you do run into people heading for the shops or the pharmacy the awareness that you must avoid each other is creating new complicity like dance where you can touch One can only hope something of this shared understanding will remain ,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

ffhp75f,Here you go gt Four cases of the deadly coronavirus have been confirmed in Australia as authorities scramble to contact passengers who shared flights from China with the patients Three men tested positive to the respiratory condition in NSW on Saturday state health authorities confirmed It comes after another man aged in his tested positive in Melbourne hospital after arriving from the Chinese city of Guangzhou last week total of people have been tested for the virus in NSW with of those given the all clear Nine people in Queensland have returned negative results for coronavirus with authorities on Saturday still waiting on results from another possible case Four people in South Australia were also being tested but authorities said it was unlikely they actually had the virus with man also being checked in Hobart hospital The first confirmed Australian case involved man who had been in Wuhan the city of million people at the epicentre of the outbreak He flew from Guangzhou to Melbourne on China Southern Airlines flight CZ on January The man has pneumonia and is in stable condition in isolation at the Monash Medical Centre Passengers from the same flight are being contacted as precaution while all arrivals from China are being stopped at airports and given information about symptoms and what to do if they feel unwell He did not show any symptoms whilst he was on the flight so it possible he wasn contagious but there a lot we don know about this virus at this point Victoria Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told reporters The man had taken precautions by phoning ahead and wearing mask to his GP and then the hospital where he was admitted on Friday In NSW two of the men travelled to Sydney from Wuhan and the third from China southeastern Shenzhen NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said it was matter of when not if the virus would arrive in Sydney She confirmed one man arrived in Australia on January another arrived days later and she was yet to confirm travel details for the third man Forty one people have died from the coronavirus in China out of more than cases The illness has been confirmed other countries including Thailand Japan South Korea Hong Kong Singapore France and the United States Australians are being urged not to travel to Wuhan or China Hubei province The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has listed the virus as having pandemic potential This allows for enhanced border protection measures Experts are still learning about the virus and Australia Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says it important people arriving from Wuhan as well as those in close contact with them look out for symptoms of fever cough sore throat vomiting and difficulty breathing We don know exactly how long symptoms take to show after person has been infected but there is an incubation period and some patients will have very mild symptoms Prof Murphy said PM We re taking this incredibly seriously Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the confirmation of cases in Australia had been expected and procedures were in place to manage the situation In Victoria Chinese national aged in his who had been in Wuhan and presented to GP in Melbourne on Thursday has been confirmed as Australia first case of coronavirus The confirmation today by Victorian authorities of the coronavirus case was matter that had been anticipated Scott Morrison said on Saturday The Australian government is of course taking this issue incredibly seriously The infected man in Melbourne arrived on flight CZ from Guangzhou to Melbourne at around am on January and authorities are racing to track down the patient fellow passengers He has pneumonia and is in stable condition being treated in negative pressure isolation room at Monash Medical Centre do want to stress there is no reason for alarm in the general community said Victoria health minister Jenny Mikakos We have had flu epidemics in the past including SARS and our system is geared up to deal with this situation The man had been staying with family and had not been out and about which minimised the risk to the broader community Ms Mikakos said In Queensland one person is being assessed in Brisbane for the virus after four others were given the all clear on Saturday The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade overnight raised the level of travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province to do not travel while the disease is now listed as having pandemic potential allowing border measures to be enhanced Passengers arriving on all flights from China are now being stopped and provided with health information about the virus its symptoms and what to do if they become unwell Even as we speak our border authorities and biosecurity authorities will be ensuring that those flights from China will be met by those officials Mr Morrison said We have the people and we have all the procedures that are now swinging into place The federal government said it was well equipped to deal with surge in the number of patients after cluster of new cases were confirmed in France the US and Japan with experts warning the virus is now spreading faster than SARS Australia chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said there were likely to be more cases outside of China after the US confirmed second case of the virus and European authorities confirmed the flu like virus had arrived in France with three cases detected one in Bordeaux and two close relatives in Paris China has confirmed deaths from the virus including doctor that had been treating infected patients at

fi95qit,Here some stuff d like to talk about with my spouse who isn interested in even having the convo Apparently of the world population is in some kinda quarantine involuntary lockdown sheltering at home China is assembling pre fab hospitals at rate of like beds per week These hospitals have bars on the windows per photos published in NYT like prison It not just killing the sick and the old like flu or pneumonia It killing fit young doctors and nurses and other regular people Of course the sick and the old are dying too Apparently every person who gets the virus infects an average of about five other people https www medrxiv org content That rate of transmission infectiousness was probably higher the first month or so in China before they locked down population of at risk people greater than combined population of every country in North America or the European Union Perhaps as high as people infected by each infectious person Compared to everywhere else on Earth Vhina has very competent forceful government and its citizens for various reasons tolerate degree of government authority that is unique on the planet In other countries governments are less effective at this type of emergency response and people are more independent and stubbornly wilfull The point being this will be the most effective and largest quarantine in human history The rest of the planet is more likely to see higher rates of infection per infected compared to China And the rest of the planet is less likely to build new hospital beds per week in the first two weeks per NYT story couple weeks ago Compared to here in Silicon Valley that is more hospital beds than we HAVE total ie than we built over decades More than of the people who get this virus die Perhaps as many as in places where the quarantine and medical intervention are already on red alert max effective Hubei for example In places where the quarantine and medical interventions had to shift from business as usual into crisis mode the fatality rate may be as high as In Wuhan over the last month for example Viruses that have transaction coefficient called or Nought of new infections per infected person are relatively rare Viruses that have fatality rate of are relatively rare Viruses that have combination of infection rate of new infections per infected person let call that growth rate AND mortality rate of let call that death rate are exceptionally rare One example worth comparing and keeping in the back of our minds is the Spanish Flu of This bug killed at least people some estimates as high as It was notable for high death rates of healthy people in their and not just the sick or old or the young like some other bugs This one virus killed more than perhaps as many people as WW The global population during the Spanish Flu was about per https www census gov data tables time series demo international programs historical est worldpop html Assuming the low estimate of and high estimate for global pop of B then approximately of the human on Earth were killed by that one virus The apparent mortality rate of the ongoing Coronavirus or whatever you want to call it is about of the infected Some estimates from reputable sources today speculate that this virus could infected as many as of living humans The current global population is at least ie two thirds of global population is about so IF the people estimating this bug may infect of us are correct we re looking at more than infected over the next year or two If the current empiric mortality rate of approx were to hold constant and not be reduced by improved treatment or increased by reduced quarantine or treatment efficacy outside of China then of is Dead One hundred and twenty million dead would be lot real catastrophe That may seem like an absurd number more than all war combined over the last century but remember the Spanish Flu killed when the global population was less than of today population Working against us in at species level was the absence of modern communications modern healthcare and modern global logistics for the transport of information precaution and solutions Working against us in at species level is the presence of modern global logistics and international travel airplanes etc combined with the apparent ease with which malign actors can weaponize the internet to spread disinformation fear and panic There are two viruses we need to be concerned about Both kill One is Coronavirus The other is the mind killer fear Both can make normal people desperate and dangerous Both are worthy of attention and prudent preparation just in case If you are week late buying food water medicine masks whatever you need to live OK during quarantine or supply shortage If you are week late you re competing with everyone you know everyone in town to stay alive without the things you need or want That dangerous Better to be week early Better safe than sorry Of course we all hope this blows over and that the doomer prepper types are wasting their money and freaking out for no justifiable reason But what if they are right It not clear if we can rely on the governments and the media companies to be honest about what is happening This is concerning and we each need to make up our own minds about what to do about it What right for some of us based on where and how we live won be the same for others That OK There is no right answer to What should do and for some people perhaps many people the answer is Nothing That their right But if even SOME of the points above concern you personally then you need to make up your own mind soon what to about it Because wherever you live if you re not in China people just like us were having the same basic concerns and same basic conversations Months ago When only few people per day were getting sick And now in dozens of countries around the world we may be finding ourselves in the same boat Is it November in Wuhan where you live What would you do if you knew that were the

fk02bgm,Here is the translation done with deepl com amp B gt In reality TV superstar Kim Kardashian twittered famous statistic According to this on average two Americans become victims of immigrant Islamic terrorists every year At the same time people are killed by their lawnmowers every year The terrorist threat should not be exaggerated was the political thrust of the Tweet It was chosen by the British Royal Statistical Society as International Statistics of the Year because it shed an enlightening light on the real risks of life and the misunderstandings associated with them He fitted in well with the times the Trump government had imposed an entry ban on people from predominantly Islamic countries gt gt gt gt Unfortunately the Statistics Society was subject to fundamental misunderstanding which was impaled by Norman Fenton Professor of Computer Science in London He showed that the risks are simply not comparable Every year people die by lawnmowers but there is no mechanism that would cause this number to suddenly skyrocket unless one makes grotesque assumptions The lawnmower does not want to kill people gt gt gt gt The comparison with the flu misrepresents the risk gt gt Terrorists on the other hand want to kill people and certainly in large numbers America has recorded handful of terror victims over many years but in there were around deaths in the attack on the World Trade Center and other facilities terrorist may carry out several attacks or one with several deaths He can obtain more and more modern weapons which are more deadly than anything that has ever been seen before Therefore it makes sense to use dramatically more resources to fight terrorism than to optimize lawnmower security gt gt gt gt The risk quality of the coronavirus is comparable to terrorist attacks in terms of the severity of the extreme case Nobody knows exactly how bad it can get but it can get very bad Nobody knows exactly who is infected because percent of those who are infected do not show any noticeable symptoms Nobody knows exactly how long once infected people are contagious up to days seems possible And no one knows of cure gt gt gt gt But we do know that the disease is highly contagious and that it leads to death in one to three percent of cases The virus surpasses the ordinary flu in terms of speed of spread and lethality which for example killed America in the season in percent of cases gt gt gt gt This should make it clear that the comparison with influenza which is often used by politicians publicists and notorious know it alls should not be pursued any further The comparisons of the virus with smoking or traffic accidents which are propagated with trivialising effect are also completely mistaken These life risks do not suddenly explode gt gt gt gt Panic is essential for survival from the point of view of behavioural scientists gt gt Against this background all those well meaning warnings to the population not to panic are questionable From the perspective of behavioural scientists panic is essential for survival It stands for an evolutionary adaptation of the body which favours the quick escape from particularly dangerous situations or the fight for survival This alarm mechanism has ensured human survival gt gt gt gt However what is currently referred to with degrading intent as panic behaviour does not fit into this category anyway Hoard purchases additional hygiene and the self imposed contact barriers with which people are currently reacting to the epidemic are far too foresighted for that There is no panic there is planning gt gt gt gt What the leaders supported by self interest optimists like DFB officials or the Tesla boss actually wanted to say and often do is not panic but overreaction But precisely this paradoxical as it may seem is civic duty in the event of pandemic risks as the philosopher publicist and risk expert Nassim Taleb makes clear His argument the individual risk of being infected at the beginning of an infectious epidemic may be very low Therefore those who do not take additional protective measures contribute to the spread of the epidemic which thus becomes serious danger Translated only insignificantly imprecisely this means that panic is the order of the day gt gt gt gt Projections highlight capacity problems gt gt Unfortunately decision makers and ordinary people alike share weakness that favours convenience instead They have no sense of multiplicative processes American complexity researcher Yaneer Bar Yam makes the following calculation In mid January China had around cases of illness At the initial rate of spread China would have had around million infected people five weeks later if the country had not taken drastic measures gt gt gt gt Another calculation comes from Justin Fox editor in chief of the Harvard Business Review In influenza claimed about lives in the United States about people were hospitalized and million showed flu symptoms If expert estimates of the speed of spread and lethality of the corona virus are correct it can exceed the flu without countermeasures For America this would mean to deaths from four million to eight million hospitalizations gt gt gt gt These figures highlight capacity problem that is affecting all countries America has about one million hospital beds pandemic claims doctors nurses and hospitals which are therefore not available for classical diseases People then die not only from the pandemic but also from the lack of treatment for other diseases Do we need more arguments for the urgently needed slowing down of the epidemic gt gt gt gt The multiplicative process contains an implied appeal to decision makers They must act quickly After all measure that possibly stops the spread of the disease in the early stages may prove to be too small just one week later In past epidemics and pandemics the closure of schools in regions where there is an outbreak of disease has proved to be particularly effective This is because it forces not only children to stay at home but also their parents gt gt gt gt The radical reduction of contacts is the prerequisite for the containment of the disease Socially underdeveloped countries such as the United States should accompany the absence with continued pay and guaranteed employment especially for the ten million or so employees in the American catering industry Otherwise they will inevitably cough into the soup in the restaurant because they don dare stay at home for fear of being fired gt gt gt gt The temptation to take half hearted measures is great because the necessary restrictions on mobility come at high economic price However this is outweighed by the price of measures that do not go far enough Perhaps for once one must take dusty motto to heart Learning from your big brother means learning to win China has succeeded in stopping the spread of the virus with painful and draconian measures It does not take much to predict that the country will soon be safer than the rest of the world ,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
fkatd5y,Yes BUT keep in mind the first few waves of novel virus are usually by far the worse as it will take out kill those with less immune ability to fight it first And with yet more additional waves after that lot of the population who experienced it will already have immunity so those waves will not be anywhere near as dramatic Most likely AND ultimately by then there should be vaccine so that will further GREATLY limit it spread and negative impact in subsequent years And so after all that This particular Corona virus SARS CoV will end up becoming just another seasonal cold or flu that no longer has dramatic effect like this on civilization Sure some years it might pop back up little more prominently while other years it will just mostly be background virus lingering but again not doing much impact to civilization On final note such virus could mutate and then pack more of punch once again But often with such mutations the people exposed to the first version still have some degree of immune resistance to it Kinda like in the more distant days when those exposed to Cow Pox had some decent degree of immunity to Small Pox But every now and then sometimes viral mutation can be severe and past immunity doesn help If that happens then we go through this whole process yet again Which eventually we will nature always has new plague in store for us at some point But hopefully the next time around in the FUTURE we ll be better prepared as society now that we ve experienced this with more face masks in storage for these kinds of things since that can really help infected people not spread it as much more ventilators at hospitals on standby better response time with vaccines better protocols and response by governments to doctors who report possible outbreaks or novel viruses ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

average of out of days of his presidency when he uses taxpayer money to fly down to his private resort in Florida and then hosts important conversations with world leaders there with absolutely zero

solve the coronavirus problem know that officially Pence is in charge but Kushner literally tried to Crowdsource ideas for solving the coronavirus contagion yesterday when he refuses to explain to the press or the public what he is doing or why and has his press secretaries attack and criticize the media for doing their job and then stops giving regular press conferences at all when he puts up political cronies and the secret service and hundreds of people in important positions at his own resorts and hotels all over the country effectively paying himself government money through back channels when he refuses to play by the rule of the emoluments clause and continues to benefit financially from not just tiny peanut farm like Jimmy Carter was accused of doing but from properties all over the world when despite claiming exactly the opposite he continues to build new hotels in Turkey and Russia and elsewhere when he nominates and fills the federal courts with terrifyingly inexperienced judges including one recent one who not only had never acted as judge before but she had never tried case in her life even as an attorney oh oops did say one because there have been at

with China which is stating that Seoul and Beijing will increase military hotlines and other exchanges South Korea has decided to keep the US GSOMIA and to increase the number of THAAD stations in the

yet wretched endeavour understand why you are looking other parts of the world for the probable culprit other than China if this pandemic was indeed intended But is there really no reason for China to have done it Like the point mentioned above regard the US China is not one unit yet In my understanding although in Xi Jinping was able to set himself up to remain president for life he is still on

possible that Shanghai clique amp Communist Youth League of China are still gunning for unseating Xi Jinping Can this pandemic be one of their attempt for soft coup after all those defeats As many examples show since the trade war has begun China has been in difficult time regarding the economy By momentarily shutting down the economy of the nation amp the other parts of the world is it
